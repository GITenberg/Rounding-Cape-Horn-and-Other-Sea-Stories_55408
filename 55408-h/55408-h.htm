</a>The hands of the clock in the life-saving station pointed to
a quarter of nine, on a wild March night along the New England
coast.&nbsp; A bitter north-easter raged outside, driving the
rising tide higher and higher upon the beach.&nbsp; It was almost
at the flood, and only a narrow ridge of stones lay between the
sea and the station.&nbsp; The surf thundered in like a solid
wall&mdash;great combers that nothing could resist, flung
themselves upon the beach with a sullen roar, and broke into a
seething flood of foam.&nbsp; This foam was not the sparkling
white substance into which the waves resolve themselves in time
of peace, but a <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>turbid yellowish froth, which, by the time it reached the
shore, was nearly of the consistency of white of egg, beaten
stiff.&nbsp; Great patches of it were caught up by the fierce
wind and blown far inland, while others lodged against the walls
of the life-saving station, where they mingled with the pelting
snow that thickly covered the weather-side of the building.&nbsp;
The water&rsquo;s edge was piled with a tangled mass of sea-weed,
drift-wood, bottles, dead crabs, and a hundred different objects
which the ocean had cast up.&nbsp; The undertow dragged out
myriads of pebbles, which gave forth a peculiar musical roar as
they were swept from the beach where they had lain through weeks
of pleasant weather, now to be again swallowed up in the
deep.&nbsp; The blackness out to sea was almost
tangible&mdash;the force of the wind and the driving snow nearly
blinded the patrolmen, struggling along their beats with every
sense on the alert, and with only their beach lanterns for
company.&nbsp; In a word, it was one of those awful nights when
the government life-savers are often called upon to work like <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>Spartan heroes,
and suffer incredible hardships and dangers that imperilled lives
may be saved.&nbsp; One such night far out-balances the long term
of inactivity (broken only by daily drill) that may have preceded
it.</p>
<p>Captain Litchfield, the keeper of the station, was in the
observatory, whose windows commanded a view of the ocean and
beach for a long distance in either direction.&nbsp; Occasionally
he caught a glimpse of the lighthouse two miles to the north, but
the cheerful beacon was rendered dim by the snow which filled the
air, and was invisible much of the time.&nbsp; As a violent gust
beat against the frosty panes and shook the stout building, the
keeper thought of the <i>Peruvian</i>, and other good ships that
had met their fate on the Massachusetts coast during just such
nights as this.&nbsp; He had doubled the beach patrol and now
strained his eyes in momentary expectation of seeing the signal
to all that coast that a disaster had occurred.&nbsp; It is a
thrilling time&mdash;waiting and watching to hear the news of a
wreck that is certain to <a name="page10"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 10</span>take place; striving to locate the
doomed craft in the profound darkness out at sea; hoping against
hope that some miracle may avert the impending catastrophe!</p>
<p>Just at dusk that evening, the men at Fourth Cliff Station (a
few miles to the south) had sighted a large brig close-hauled and
struggling northward under storm sails.&nbsp; The blinding storm
had apparently prevented those on board from seeing how
perilously near they were to land, but they soon after discovered
their danger, for more sail was clapped on the vessel&mdash;much
more than she could safely carry&mdash;and she tore through the
water at a great rate, in a desperate endeavor to drive past the
outlying rocks and shoals off Scituate and Cohasset.&nbsp; The
attempt might have succeeded had it not been for the fearful
leeway the craft was making, but it seemed as though every
cable&rsquo;s length she advanced brought her perceptibly nearer
to the beach.</p>
<p>Night soon hid the brig from view, but the keeper&rsquo;s
experience told him that her fate was sealed, and he burned red
rockets <a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 11</span>to
warn the adjacent station to be on the lookout for the wreck
which must soon take place.&nbsp; Thus it was that Captain
Litchfield and his crew had been for several hours in momentary
expectation of a summons to save human life.&nbsp; Half way
between the two stations a rocky point jutted out into the water,
and here it was that both keepers expected the brig to strike;
but by an extraordinary exhibition of pluck and good seamanship,
she cleared this danger.</p>
<p>As the minutes passed, the crowd of half-frozen villagers on
the beach concluded that the vessel had managed to escape to the
open sea, and began to realize that their limbs were cold and
numb.&nbsp; The greater part betook themselves to their cottages;
mayhap to listen to some harrowing tale of shipwreck and death
from the lips of an octogenarian smoking his pipe in the chimney
corner, while drift-wood snapped and blazed upon the fire, and
the housewife heated over the remnants of a chowder with which to
cheer the stomachs of the returned watchers, ere <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>they sought
the doubtful warmth of their bed rooms.</p>
<p>But the station crew redoubled their vigilance.&nbsp; They
well knew the brig could not tack in that furious gale, and there
was not room to wear, without taking ground;&mdash;</p>
<p>The signal!</p>
<p>A patrolman on the northern beat had suddenly ignited his
Coston light&mdash;the red emblem which both tells the watchful
keeper that a wreck has been sighted, and assures the crew of the
unfortunate vessel that succor is at hand.</p>
<p>The surfmen and patrolmen passed the signal along the beats
and hurried to the station, each to perform his allotted part in
the work of rescue.&nbsp; The keeper burned a rocket to inform
the Fourth Cliff crew.&nbsp; It was answered almost
simultaneously by a distant patrolman with his handlight, and by
a white rocket sent up from Fourth Cliff; the crew and apparatus
from that point would soon be hurrying to the scene of the
wreck.</p>
<p>The patrolman who gave the alarm had <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>sighted the
brig just before she went aground.&nbsp; She was then headed
directly for the beach, bows on, her captain evidently realizing
that escape was impossible, and that his only chance lay in
getting the craft near the shore.&nbsp; The tide was high, and
she had taken ground scarcely a quarter of a mile from the beach,
and almost directly in front of the station.&nbsp; Immediately
after striking, she had swung around broadside on, and now the
dim outline of her canvas and rigging could be faintly
distinguished through the storm.</p>
<p>In the station all was excitement and action, but there was no
confusion.&nbsp; Within a few moments of the time the wreck had
been sighted, the keeper issued the first order: &ldquo;Open
boat-room doors&mdash;man the beach-cart!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Laden with the life-saving apparatus, and drawn by six
surfmen, the cart was hauled out of the station and over the
loose, yielding stones that lay between it and the ocean.&nbsp;
The wide tires prevented the vehicle from sinking among the
stones and rendered the task not difficult.&nbsp; The <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>tremendous
surf booming in made it impossible to launch the life-boat, and
it was through the medium of the breeches buoy that the
brig&rsquo;s crew were to be rescued.</p>
<p>Bad news travels swiftly, and a rapidly increasing knot of
men, boys, and even a few women was already assembled, many of
whom offered assistance, while one or two did not hesitate to
give advice.&nbsp; The keeper directed them to procure dry wood
from the station and start a bonfire, which they did with
alacrity, the flames soon crackling merrily.</p>
<p>The cart having been halted, the crew proceeded to unload it,
and while Captain Litchfield placed the gun in position, the
others buried the sand-anchor, prepared the shot-line box, set
the crotch in the proper place, and performed other duties of
importance.&nbsp; Everything about the stranded vessel was dark
and silent.&nbsp; She displayed no mast-head lantern or any light
whatever, her crew having probably taken to the rigging as soon
as she struck to avoid being washed overboard.&nbsp; The fierce
gale cut the faces and blinded the eyes of the <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>life-savers
when they attempted to look towards the wreck, but the keeper
contrived to train the gun and raise it to the proper elevation
for firing.&nbsp; All things being ready, he gave the lanyard a
sharp pull.&nbsp; There was a report, a puff of smoke, and away
sped the metal cylinder into the blackness, with the shot-line
attached.</p>
<p>A few minutes passed, during which some of the crew had a
chance to warm their numb fingers at the fire.&nbsp; The
direction of the wind was favorable, and the keeper had strong
hopes of getting that first line over the vessel.&nbsp; But there
was no pull upon it&mdash;nothing to show that those on the wreck
had seen it.&nbsp; And yet it had certainly fallen on the brig,
for all attempts by those on shore to withdraw it were
futile.&nbsp; Perhaps the unfortunate crew knew the line was on
deck, but were unable to reach it without being washed away;
perhaps they were too thoroughly chilled to make any exertion in
their own behalf, although this seemed scarcely possible in view
of the short time the vessel had been aground.&nbsp; But at any
rate they failed to <a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>secure the line, and in trying to haul it back on shore
it parted somewhere off in the darkness.</p>
<p>The operation had to be repeated, and a second shot was fired
as quickly as the apparatus could be made ready.&nbsp; This was a
complete failure, for it did not go over the brig at all.&nbsp;
The third attempt promised to be crowned with success, for the
line not only fell upon the vessel, but came within reach of the
beleagured crew&mdash;a fact that was soon made apparent by a
decided pull upon it.&nbsp; It was the first evidence of life
upon the wreck, and sent a thrill through the breasts of the
rescuers.</p>
<p>Number One had just bent the shot-line around the whip, and
the keeper was about to signal the wreck to haul off, when the
line again parted.&nbsp; This was a keen disappointment, for
precious moments must be consumed in preparing the apparatus for
another shot; and evidence was not lacking to show that the seas
were making a clean breach over the wreck, sweeping her decks of
everything movable.&nbsp; A small boat, one end in splinters, was
flung <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 17</span>upon
the beach almost at the foot of the rescuers; in the edge of the
surf was something that resembled a hen-coop; one of the
villagers discovered a flight of steps and several planks a
little to the right of the station; and other familiar objects
were rapidly coming ashore.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p17.jpg">
<img alt=
"The Life-Savers at Work"
title=
"The Life-Savers at Work"
 src="images/p17.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The fourth shot proved successful, and after the brig&rsquo;s
crew secured the line, the whip was attached to it and those on
the wreck hauled off until the whip was within their reach.&nbsp;
The two surfmen tending the shore ends soon felt several pulls,
which they interpreted as a signal that the tail-block had been
made fast on the brig.&nbsp; Now the lee part of the whip was
bent on to the hawser close to the tally-board, <a
name="citation17a"></a><a href="#footnote17a"
class="citation">[17a]</a> and while one man saw that it did not
foul the hawser, others manned the weather whip and thus hauled
the hawser off to the wreck.&nbsp; The breeches buoy block <a
name="citation17b"></a><a href="#footnote17b"
class="citation">[17b]</a> was <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>next attached, after which operations
were suspended until a signal should be received from the
stranded vessel that the hawser had been made fast to one of the
masts.&nbsp; The length of time that the brig&rsquo;s crew
required to perform this ordinarily simple act told the
life-savers, as plainly as words could have done, how greatly
they were exhausted by their two hours&rsquo; exposure to the
bitter wind and icy spray.&nbsp; Their stiffened fingers at
length gave the signal, and the station crew quickly hauled in
the slack of the hawser.&nbsp; The crotch was now raised, which
had the effect of elevating the hawser above the surface of the
ocean sufficiently for the breeches buoy to travel upon it
without touching the water.&nbsp; All was ready, and the keeper
ordered: &ldquo;Man lee whip&mdash;haul off!&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the buoy slid easily along the hawser and vanished in the
darkness towards the wreck, the pent-up feelings of the villagers
burst forth.&nbsp; The boys yelled, shouted hurrahs, and danced
like sprites about the fire, upon which they flung more
drift-wood.&nbsp; Men and women pressed closer <a
name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>about the
keeper and his assistants, shading their eyes with their hands,
as they strove to follow the course of the buoy.&nbsp; Lips moved
and limbs trembled, but as much from excitement as from cold.</p>
<p>At this juncture the Fourth Cliff crew arrived, having toiled
for two hours through snow-drifts, and over loose stones, with
their heavy apparatus.&nbsp; It had been found impossible to
obtain horses in the neighborhood without great delay, and the
men were thus compelled to set out without them.&nbsp; The major
part of the work of rescue was already done, allowing the
half-frozen crew time to warm themselves at the fire, where they
held themselves in readiness to render instant service.</p>
<p>The signal from the brig having been given, Captain Litchfield
commanded: &ldquo;Man weather whip&mdash;haul
ashore!&rdquo;&nbsp; The men hauled in the whip with a will,
while the villagers, eager to get a glimpse of the approaching
buoy and its human freight, crowded about until the keeper was
compelled to order them back.</p>
<p><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 20</span>Now the
poor fellow was visible!&nbsp; Just as he neared the edge of the
surf, a huge comber about to break reared its foaming crest and
buried hawser, buoy and man in a cloud of spray, as though making
a last attempt to seize its intended victim.&nbsp; When the buoy
emerged and was drawn up to the crotch, the keeper and Number
Seven stepped forward and helped the rescued seaman out.&nbsp;
The buoy was then hurried back to the wreck, while its drenched
occupant was turned over to the Fourth Cliff crew, who took him
to the station.</p>
<p>He was a large man, and evidently a Scandinavian, but seemed
exhausted or stunned to such an extent that little information
could be obtained from him, except that there were seven men
still on the wreck.&nbsp; His wet clothes were removed, and after
a good rubbing, he was placed in one of the snowy beds in the
upper story of the station.&nbsp; Here in a large, pleasant room,
stood a number of single iron bedsteads with heads to the
wall&mdash;one for each of the crew, besides a few extra in case
of emergency.&nbsp; In this haven <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>of rest the sailor fell into a deep
sleep, heedless of the storm and cold without.</p>
<p>The next man landed proved to be the mate&mdash;a small, wiry
fellow, who bore his sufferings well.&nbsp; He thanked the keeper
and surfman who helped him out of the buoy and stamped upon the
wet sand as though enjoying the sensation of having something
firm beneath his feet.&nbsp; His hands were stiff from clinging
to the rigging, and were almost useless from the action of the
bitter wind and freezing water.&nbsp; But he picked up fast, and
after borrowing a dry suit of clothes and an overcoat, insisted
on returning to the beach.</p>
<p>He reported the vessel to be the <i>Huron</i>, a 400-ton brig,
bound from Porto Rico to Boston, with molasses.&nbsp; The weather
had been thick, and though for two days they had had no
observation, the captain believed himself a good distance from
the coast.&nbsp; When land was sighted on the port bow, they
shook out more sail and tried to drive past; but all efforts to
keep the brig off shore were futile, and seeing that she must
soon strike, the captain <a name="page22"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 22</span>headed her for the beach at full
speed.&nbsp; The mate reported the wreck to be breaking up
rapidly, but thought she might hold together until all had been
saved.</p>
<p>The cook and three more seamen had been landed meanwhile,
leaving only the captain and a Spanish sailor on the stranded
vessel.&nbsp; The buoy had just started on its seventh trip to
the brig, when those tending the whip noticed something
wrong.&nbsp; The hawser suddenly slackened to such an extent as
to allow the buoy to touch the water.&nbsp; A second more, and
the great rope which had bridged the chasm between the brig and
the shore became perfectly limp, and fell into the ocean!&nbsp; A
groan broke from the throng upon the beach as they realized the
extent of this misfortune.&nbsp; The mast which upheld the two
remaining castaways&mdash;the mast to which the hawser was
secured, had fallen!&nbsp; All communication between the wreck
and the shore was effectually cut off.&nbsp; Even at that moment
the two unfortunates were being buffeted about in the freezing
water, unless they <a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
23</span>had been killed or rendered unconscious by the falling
spars.</p>
<p>Both men had on life-preservers, which gave them a slight
chance for their lives.&nbsp; The chance was indeed a frail one,
but it was all there was left&mdash;the poor fellows might
possibly be thrown upon the beach before life was extinct.</p>
<p>Both station crews and dozens of volunteers were marshalled
into line and stationed along the edge of the surf, ready to
grasp the bodies should they come within reach.&nbsp; Wreckage
was coming ashore rapidly; and alive or dead, the keeper felt
certain that the brig&rsquo;s captain and his companion would
soon appear in the breakers.</p>
<p>Scarce fifteen minutes passed before two surfmen in close
proximity flashed their lanterns, and all those near by hurried
to the spot.&nbsp; One of the bodies was in sight close to the
shore.&nbsp; As the rescuers prepared to wade in, a breaking wave
took up the limp form and hurled it down with terrific force, at
the same time carrying it towards shore.&nbsp; The receding <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>water drew
the body back a short distance, and then left it upon the
sand.&nbsp; Willing hands took up the burden and hurried it to
the station.&nbsp; A glance showed it to be the captain.</p>
<p>The other body was discovered by the Fourth Cliff keeper, a
considerable distance down the beach to the right of the
station.&nbsp; It, too, was floating near shore.&nbsp; Six men
ranged themselves along a rope, the keeper being at the outer end
with a grappling hook, Thus they waded into the surf and
endeavored to catch the body.&nbsp; Four successive times were
those furthest out carried off their feet and thrown down in the
water before their object was accomplished, and the body drawn
out of the breakers.&nbsp; Like that of the captain, it was
seemingly lifeless.</p>
<p>The men&rsquo;s clothing was ripped off, and for several hours
the crews worked over them, skilfully practicing the most
approved methods for restoring the apparently
drowned,&mdash;methods by which scores of people seemingly dead
have been resuscitated, and in which all persons connected <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>with the
United States Life-Saving Service are required to be
proficient.&nbsp; Every means approved by science and the wide
experience of the operators was tried, but all to no
purpose.&nbsp; The vital spark was extinguished; the captain of
the brig and the Spanish sailor had drawn their last breath.</p>
<p>Next morning the sky was clear, the snow had ceased, the wind
shifted into the north-west, and it was stinging cold.&nbsp; The
sea had been busy with its work of destruction during the hours
of darkness, and the staunch brig of yesterday was strewn
piece-meal along the beach.&nbsp; Stout oak beams and iron
girders were splintered, twisted, or rent asunder, while the
thick coat of ice with which they were covered, caused them to
assume strangely fantastic shapes.&nbsp; The two masts had come
ashore; mattresses, provisions of all sorts, boxes, rigging, the
cabin floor, and countless casks of molasses, lay scattered upon
the beach for leagues in both directions.</p>
<p>Many vessels ended their careers on that terrible night, and
many lives were lost, <a name="page26"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 26</span>from the Delaware Capes to the shores
of Nova Scotia.&nbsp; But scores were saved and alive next
morning, who, but for the heroic exertions of the government
life-savers, would have perished miserably.&nbsp; These men did
only their duty, but in many cases that duty compelled them to
take their lives in their hands, and they did it without
shrinking.</p>
<p>People all over the country read in the papers that morning of
wrecks by the dozen; of deaths innumerable from freezing,
drowning, and exposure; of terrible hardships endured for many
hours by unfortunates whom human aid was powerless to save; and
they said, &ldquo;What an awful night it was!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then
they turned to their usual occupations, and the subject was
forgotten.&nbsp; How should those who spent the night in a warm
bed, far from the sound of the waves, have any real conception of
the fearful struggles with death represented by those inanimate
lines?</p>

27</span>THANKSGIVING ON THE DICKY BIRD.</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/p28.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

"Thanksgiving on the Dicky Bird"

</a>Many years ago I was mate of the little schooner <i>Dicky
Bird</i>. She traded mostly between the West Indies and Gulf
ports, once in a while getting a charter for some point in
Central America.&nbsp; On this particular voyage, she was bound
across the Gulf from Pensacola to Vera Cruz.</p>
<p>We were a queer company; three whites and eight blacks.&nbsp;
Cap&rsquo;n Thomas Pratt was a first rate seaman when he
wasn&rsquo;t in liquor, although too easy-going to suit some
people.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t believe in knocking the hands
about, and always said that swearing at &rsquo;em did just as
much good.&nbsp; I have met some people who didn&rsquo;t think <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>even that was
right, but they were mostly preachers or lubbers who knew mighty
little of merchant sailors.&nbsp; Let them try moral suasion on a
mule for a while if they want to see how it works with a
sailor.&nbsp; If you never swear at &rsquo;em, they get lazy and
despise you, besides thinking you a milk-sop.</p>
<p>But as I said, Cap&rsquo;n Pratt took a drop too much now and
then; mostly after dinner, for he kept pretty straight until the
sun was taken.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no teetotlar myself, though I was
green enough to sign the pledge before I&rsquo;d got to what they
call &ldquo;the age of reason.&rdquo;&nbsp; Still, it goes
against my idees for a skipper to drink much when on duty, and if
Pratt hadn&rsquo;t owned his schooner, I reckon he&rsquo;d lost
his berth long before I knew him.&nbsp; After working out his
sights he used to take a drink by way of celebration in case the
day&rsquo;s run had been good, and if we&rsquo;d made a poor
record he just took something to drown his sorrows&mdash;and
sometimes it needed a deal of liquor to drown &rsquo;em.</p>
<p>There was no second mate, so the Cap&rsquo;n <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>and me stood
watch and watch.&nbsp; We had a negro bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un called
Prince Saunders&mdash;a strapping big fellow as black as the ace
of spades&mdash;who was on duty all day from seven in the morning
till six at night. Then he turned in till next day, unless all
hands were called.&nbsp; Prince acted as general overseer, and
the way he made those darkeys come to time wasn&rsquo;t
slow.&nbsp; In fact, I wouldn&rsquo;t ask for a better
bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un or a better crew.&nbsp; All the Cap&rsquo;n
and me had to do was to lay out the day&rsquo;s work and Prince
saw that it was done.</p>
<p>The three fellows in my watch looked exactly alike&mdash;I
never could tell one negro from another&mdash;so I called
&rsquo;em Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.&nbsp; I forgot what Pratt
named his.</p>
<p>Steamers were scarce in the Gulf those days, and people
wanting to go any distance had to take passage on whatever craft
they could find, which was how we came to have the Honorable Mr.
Warriner for a passenger.&nbsp; I couldn&rsquo;t see as he had
any more honor than lots of other people, but all of his mail was
addressed that way, <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>and Pratt said it was a kind of title they have on
shore.&nbsp; He was a red faced, pompous old duck, with too much
corporation, and looked as much out of place on the deck of that
little schooner as I would scraping before Queen Victoria.&nbsp;
Every time we had a squall he got almighty sick, and when a good
hot day came how he did sweat and mop his face!&nbsp; I really
pitied him.</p>
<p>Once he said to me: &ldquo;Mr. Hunt, I would give any
reasonable amount to be as slender as you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We thin chaps certainly have the advantage in the
tropics, Mr. Warriner; and ever since I was seventeen, and had
the yellow fever at Rio, there ain&rsquo;t been any more meat on
me than there is on a starved horse,&rdquo; I answered.</p>
<p>I had no call to feel flattered, but I was, just the same, for
Pratt sometimes poked fun at me for being so d&mdash;d lean; and
didn&rsquo;t I find a picture drawn on the bulwarks forward of an
oar with clothes on that looked kind of like me?&nbsp; If I could
have found out which of those black sons <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>of Belial did
it, he would have caught a whaling, you bet!</p>
<p>We had a cook who also waited off at table,&mdash;a steward
was too much luxury for the <i>Dicky Bird</i>, and of all the
infernal liars that ever lived, I believe that Cornwallis
Tecumseh Jones was the worst.&nbsp; He knew his business pretty
well, and could turn a flap-jack by throwing it up in the air
from one window of the galley, and catching it as it came down by
the window on the opposite side. <a name="citation31"></a><a
href="#footnote31" class="citation">[31]</a></p>
<p>The passenger, Pratt and me were talking of various things one
afternoon when Warriner said: &ldquo;Captain, to-morrow will be
Thanksgiving, and I propose that we observe the day by having
some appropriate dish for dinner.&nbsp; Turkey and pumpkin pie
are out of the question, so what do you say to an English
plum-pudding?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Anything, sir; anything to keep the peace.&nbsp;
Plum-pudding or pear-pudding, Thanksgiving or
lobscouse.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>(Pratt
was about half heeled over, as usual with him that time of
day.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lobscouse!&nbsp; Captain Pratt, I will thank you not to
mention that abominable mixture in my presence.&nbsp; It passes
my comprehension how you can eat such stuff.&nbsp; Neither do I
like this flippant reference to so august a day as
Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But a plum-pudding will be excellent&mdash;that is, if
you think that darkey won&rsquo;t ruin it in the making.&nbsp; I
have a splendid recipe in my trunk, and although some of the
necessary ingredients are probably lacking, it will be possible
to produce a very fair pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s have it,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Anything for a change is my sentiments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Darkeys usually have quite a knack for cooking, and I
suppose if the recipe is placed before Cornwallis he will do the
subject justice.&nbsp; I will get it at once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Lord only knows, Mr. Warriner.&nbsp; Did you ever
hear a certain proverb that is common at sea: &lsquo;God sends
meat and the devil sends cooks?&rsquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s
astonishing how good provisions can be changed into <a
name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>all sorts of
queer shapes.&nbsp; But get your directions and take them to the
galley.&nbsp; The black imp may surprise us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pratt went below, and soon after, Warriner and me went forward
with the directions for the pudding.&nbsp; He told the cook what
was wanted and then read off the recipe, so as to be sure and
have no mistake.&nbsp; Never did I hear of such a lot of truck
being put together, and I don&rsquo;t believe the cook did
either, for his eyes got bigger and bigger as Warriner read the
list of what he called &ldquo;ingredients.&rdquo;&nbsp; My! that
pudding took some of everything.&nbsp; There was raisins,
currants, brown sugar, beef-suet, flour, bread-crumbs, citron,
candied lemon-peel, eggs, nutmeg and salt!&nbsp; &ldquo;Boil
seven hours in a buttered mould.&nbsp; A sprig of holly should be
stuck in the center.&nbsp; Pour brandy around the pudding when
ready to serve, and set it on fire.&rdquo;&nbsp; Holy
Moses!&nbsp; Then there was a sauce with brandy and other things
in it.</p>
<p>The cook sat down on a bench and looked at Warriner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Golly! you done took my bref away, <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>boss.&nbsp;
Bile seben hour!&nbsp; Whar we gwine to git dese yere
tings?&nbsp; I &rsquo;low dere ain&rsquo;t no brandy on dis
craf&rsquo;, an&rsquo; as fur ten eggs&mdash;waal, de hens is
completely gi&rsquo;n out, eben ef I does feed &rsquo;em on de
Champyun Egg Food.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should the poor things lay, shut up in a small
coop?&nbsp; But as for the brandy, I will furnish that, and also
some nice layer raisins.&nbsp; Currants, lemon-peel and citron we
must do without, but ten eggs are a necessity, and the other
things you have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We has jes&rsquo; got &rsquo;leben eggs, an&rsquo; ef
yo&rsquo; takes ten from &rsquo;leben, dar ain&rsquo;t but bery
few lef&rsquo;.&nbsp; Where we gwine to get moah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I neither know nor care,&mdash;we shall reach Vera Cruz
sometime I devoutly hope,&mdash;but ten eggs go into this
pudding.&nbsp; The question is, can you make it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Can I make it</i>?&rdquo; repeated the cook, as if
someone had asked him whether he could breathe.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Waal, sah, dere ain&rsquo;t no dish knowed to man or debil
dat dis chile can&rsquo;t make, Mistah Warmer.&nbsp; Must I bile
de sass seben hour too?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>&ldquo;Certainly not.&nbsp; The sauce must not be made
until to-morrow morning just before dinner, and is only to be
boiled a few minutes.&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t you read?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me read?&nbsp; Well, I hope not, boss.&nbsp; I&rsquo;s
got all my receipts in my head.&nbsp; None o&rsquo; yo&rsquo;
new-fangled notions fur dis niggah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had to laugh, poor Warriner looked so disgusted.&nbsp; He
just all gave up for a minute and thought the pudding was done
for.&nbsp; Then he stamped his foot and said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not to be thwarted by trifles, and will weigh out
everything myself.&nbsp; Then you can mix the articles
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warriner fetched the raisins and brandy&mdash;if he&rsquo;d
been smart he wouldn&rsquo;t have brought the brandy till the
last minute&mdash;and between &rsquo;em they managed to mix up
all the truck and get it in the mould.&nbsp; It was about the
middle of the afternoon when they got it on to boil.</p>
<p>Next day was fine, and Warriner was up before we finished
washing down the decks.&nbsp; Pratt and me were curious about the
plum-pudding, for we&rsquo;d never seen one, and wanted to know
what sort of idees the <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>passenger had about cookery.&nbsp; He
kept telling all the morning what fine ones his wife used to
make, and said he&rsquo;d show us a thing or two.&nbsp; We sat
down to dinner&mdash;our Thanksgiving dinner.&nbsp; The Honorable
looked more self-satisfied and important than usual, I thought;
Cap&rsquo;n Pratt was real good-natured and told a lot of lies
that Warriner swallowed like an albacore does a flying-fish; I
had scraped my face with an old hoe of a razor and put on a
necktie; and Cornwallis stood in the pantry door behind Pratt
with a white cap over his wool, and looking as solemn as a judge.
He did well that day, and we had a first rate dinner.&nbsp; There
was vegetable soup; chicken, rice and curry with Ceylon chutney;
potatoes; boiled onions; lime-juice; and each a cold whiskey
punch.&nbsp; At last it was time for the dessert.&nbsp;
Cornwallis took away the things, while Warriner told us how much
we had to be thankful for, and how he and the cook had worked to
make the pudding a success.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>Well,
the minute that pudding hove in sight Pratt and me laughed.&nbsp;
The middle of it was stuck full of long feathers!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens and earth!&nbsp; What are those things
for?&rdquo; cried Warriner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dem is fedders, sah.&nbsp; You tole me dat holly was to
be stuck up in de middle, but dat bush ain&rsquo;t to be
foun&rsquo; in dese pahts.&nbsp; I done de best I could,
Mass&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Was ever such a thing heard of!&nbsp; And are those
feathers from the chicken we have just eaten?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laws, no.&nbsp; I done kotched de rooster&mdash;Golly!
how dat ole bird did squawk&mdash;and I yanked de fedders out ob
his tail.&nbsp; Dere dey is, a wavin&rsquo; like a
flag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warriner was about to pull the feathers out and throw them
away, but the Cap&rsquo;n and me rather liked the looks of
&rsquo;em, so he stopped.&nbsp; Then the sauce appeared.&nbsp;
White of egg beaten stiff was on top of it.&nbsp; Next Cornwallis
brought a dish and turned the brandy around the pudding.&nbsp;
How awful it smelled!&nbsp; Not a bit like any brandy that I ever
saw.&nbsp; Warriner looked a bit puzzled, but before he had time
to <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 38</span>say a
word the cook struck a match and touched it to the liquor.</p>
<p>The whole thing blazed right up to the skylight, and scared
all hands nearly to death!&nbsp; You could have knocked me over
with a fish-hook, and that darky rolled up the whites of his eyes
and acted as if he was praying.&nbsp; Warriner&rsquo;s face
turned all colors, and Pratt was scared and mad both.&nbsp; He
jerked the cloth and everything off the table, took off his coat
and threw it on the blaze.&nbsp; Then he stamped on it.</p>
<p>None of us spoke a word for a minute; we were clean on our
beam ends.&nbsp; Then Pratt looked at the passenger and roared
out: &ldquo;Well, sir, you&rsquo;ve raised h&mdash; with your
pudding, I must say!&nbsp; Like to have burned us all up into the
bargain.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what comes of setting brandy on
fire.&nbsp; I thought when you spoke of it, it was the
d&mdash;dest nonsense to burn up a lot of good liquor that might
better be drunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Warriner had found his voice by this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Captain Thomas Pratt, you forget yourself.&nbsp; I am
not accustomed to being <a name="page39"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 39</span>addressed in that fashion, and you
will please remember that I am a passenger on this
craft&mdash;this miserable apology for a schooner&mdash;and did
not come here to be sworn at!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old boy was on his mettle, and Pratt saw it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No offense meant, Mr. Warriner, but I insist that your
having that brandy set on fire was a rash proceeding.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brandy!&nbsp; That was not brandy.&nbsp; Do you suppose
I never saw a plum-pudding before?&nbsp; If that had been the
brandy I gave that imp of Satan&rdquo; (pointing to the cook)
&ldquo;it would never have blazed up like that.&nbsp; And what
foul odor did we smell when he poured the stuff around the
pudding?&nbsp; What odor do we smell now?&nbsp; Kerosene, or
I&rsquo;m no judge.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kerosene!&rdquo; echoed the Cap&rsquo;n.</p>
<p>I began to think the passenger knew what he was talking
about.&nbsp; All of us smelled oil, and we cast our eyes on
Cornwallis.&nbsp; He looked as innocent as a lamb.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gents, dat ain&rsquo;t possible,&rdquo; said he, his
black face shining like polished ebony.</p>
<p><a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>&ldquo;We will see about that,&rdquo; answered
Warriner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s taste the
sauce&mdash;I&rsquo;ll warrant it&rsquo;s full of kerosene
too.&rdquo; He took some in a spoon and smelled of it before
putting his tongue to it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Curious,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;there is no odor of
oil or brandy either.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then the old chap tasted it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is extraordinary!&nbsp; There&rsquo;s nothing to
this sauce&mdash;it has no body.&nbsp; There is positively not a
drop of brandy in it; nor of kerosene, for that
matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat am bery strange, Mass&rsquo; Warmer.&nbsp; De
brandy must &rsquo;a&rsquo; done &rsquo;vaporated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Evaporated down your throat, you black villain!&nbsp;
Captain Pratt, I consider this a flagrant outrage.&nbsp; I
furnished a quantity of good brandy for this pudding, not a drop
of which has been used.&nbsp; What has become of it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dat Monday or some ob de han&rsquo;s might
&rsquo;a&rsquo; stole it when I wahn&rsquo;t
lookin&rsquo;,&rdquo; suggested the cook.</p>
<p>Prince, the bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un, was standing outside near the
door, and had evidently heard part of the confab.&nbsp; He now
called out:</p>
<p><a name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
41</span>&ldquo;Ef you &rsquo;lows me, Cap&rsquo;n, I reckons I
kin find out de truf in dis argument.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Prince,&rdquo; answered Pratt.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
you can get any truth out of Cornwallis you&rsquo;re smarter than
I think you are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook looked indignant&mdash;not so much at being called a
liar as having the bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un admitted,&mdash;for he and
Prince were not on good terms, and he considered the
bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un&rsquo;s interference a piece of pure
impudence.</p>
<p>Prince entered, cap in hand.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m tolerable tall
myself, but he was a good four inches above me, and a right good
looking darkey into the bargain.&nbsp; He walked right up to the
cook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Walrus Jones, you stole dat gemmen&rsquo;s
brandy.&nbsp; You lies ef you says you didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornwallis looked at his accuser defiantly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What yo&rsquo; want wid me, niggah?&nbsp; Is yo&rsquo;
lookin&rsquo; fur trouble?&nbsp; Go &rsquo;long &rsquo;bout
yo&rsquo; bizness now, an&rsquo; doan&rsquo; be comin&rsquo; in
de cabin whar yo&rsquo; betters is.&nbsp; I&rsquo;s willin&rsquo;
to obey de Cap&rsquo;n ob dis craf&rsquo;, but I tells yo&rsquo;
now dat I won&rsquo;t take no sass from lowdown
bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;uns.&nbsp; Go an&rsquo; scar&rsquo; de life out
<a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 42</span>ob dose
pore debils in de crew, fur all I keer, but doan&rsquo; git gay
wid me.&nbsp; Huh!&nbsp; Yo&rsquo; mus&rsquo; tink I&rsquo;s
jes&rsquo; turned out!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You awoids de subjek&rsquo;.&nbsp; Dat am a shuah sign
ob guilt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lemme tell yo&rsquo; somfin&rsquo;, yo&rsquo; onery
niggah!&nbsp; I doan&rsquo; sociate wid sech trash as yo&rsquo;
be, what can&rsquo;t tell who his own fadder and mudder
was.&nbsp; I come from a hono&rsquo;ble fam&rsquo;ly what was

probokin&rsquo; me to wraf I&rsquo;ll put pizen in yo&rsquo;
wittals, dat&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ll do, an yo&rsquo; now has
fair wahnin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince showed signs of wrath himself at this speech, but Pratt
interfered before he could answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more talk about poisoning people, Cornwallis.&nbsp;
Answer me this: Where did that brandy go to?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ef it didn&rsquo;t go in dat sass an&rsquo;
aroun&rsquo; dat puddin&rsquo;, Cap&rsquo;n, den I &rsquo;lows
some ob de crew done stole it.&nbsp; Dem critters ain&rsquo;t to
be trusted, no how.&nbsp; Cockroaches is bery bad in dat galley,
too, an&rsquo; dey likes sech drinks, I hearn tell.&nbsp; Whose
to know if dey wahn&rsquo;t at de bottle?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>&ldquo;Why, you black rascal, you said not ten minutes
ago that the brandy was put in the sauce and around the
pudding!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I did, Cap&rsquo;n.&nbsp; Ef dat ain&rsquo;t de truf
an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; but de truf, I hopes de good Lawd will
hab me pah&rsquo;lized, an&rsquo; make me fall dead heah in my
tracks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Impious creature!&nbsp; Unworthy descendant of
Ham!&rdquo; cried Warriner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me a ham?&nbsp; Me, a linear decen&rsquo;ant ob de
great Lawd Cornwahlis, what lan&rsquo;ed at Yohktown an&rsquo;
chased de Yanks all ober de plains ob Ole Virgintay?&nbsp;
Dat&rsquo;s de stock I come from, Mistah Warmer, an&rsquo; so I
want yo&rsquo; to understan&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook&rsquo;s reference to his ancestors astounded
Warriner, though none of the rest of us saw anything queer about
it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&nbsp; What curse is there like
ignorance?&rdquo; said he, looking up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>It was lucky for me that Warriner spoke up, for I was just
going to show off about Lord Cornwallis, and would likely have
made a fool of myself.&nbsp; My history is a bit uncertain; so I
stood by and kept mum.</p>
<p><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>Prince
had been considering while the rest of us talked, and now said:
&ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Pratt, I would ax you, sah, for de Bible,
an&rsquo; I promises to bring dis sinful critter to time, eben of
he does b&rsquo;long to de quality ob Virginny, which he
don&rsquo;t, unless de debil hab turned saint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All of us were surprised at this, but Pratt went to fetch the
book.&nbsp; Prince could read large print tolerably well, and
write a little, which facts he was very proud of.&nbsp; His
confident air, and the new tack he had taken, made the cook a bit
uneasy for the first time.&nbsp; He had no idee what was coming
next.</p>
<p>Pratt beckoned to me from the door of his room, and whispered
in my ear: &ldquo;The Bible&rsquo;s mislaid.&nbsp; Hasn&rsquo;t
been used for so long it can&rsquo;t be found.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s
a book the same size, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try, anyway.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince took the volume of Lieut. Maury&rsquo;s sailing
directions and said impressively: &ldquo;Now, Mistah Jones,
appearances is agin you, but dey is bery deceptible, an&rsquo;
not <a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>alwuz
to be trusted.&nbsp; You may be innocenter den a kitten, which
fur y&rsquo;ur own sake, I hopes you is.&nbsp; I has here,
gemmen, de Good Book, out ob which I will read what happens to
cooks which steals.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cornwallis looked uneasily from one to the other, and at the
sacred volume.&nbsp; He was ignorant and superstitious, and
Prince as reader and oracle was much more to be feared than
Prince the bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un, with all his threats and
accusations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dis chile better be gittin&rsquo; back to de galley
an&rsquo; washin&rsquo; dem dishes.&nbsp; Neber will git
nothin&rsquo; done at dis rate, stan&rsquo;in&rsquo; aroun&rsquo;
an&rsquo; talkin&rsquo; like a lot o&rsquo; wenches at a
pic-nic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold on, Cornwallis,&rdquo; said Pratt, taking hold of
him as he neared the door. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need to be
afraid as long as you didn&rsquo;t get away with the
liquor.&nbsp; Stay right here and let&rsquo;s hear how well
Prince can read.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un had been turning over the leaves as if
searching for something, and finally stopped at a page which told
the route vessels should take when bound from <a
name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 46</span>New York to
Hong Kong and the Far East.&nbsp; Clearing his throat and putting
on a long face, he read: &ldquo;Cooks an&rsquo; stoords what
steals &rsquo;taters and won&rsquo;t confess, is boun&rsquo; to
be set on de capstan all night long till dey owns up. Nex&rsquo;
day, dey is to be whitewashed, but ef it&rsquo;s a white pusson,
he mus&rsquo; be painted black.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dem dat takes sugah is to be made to drink bilge-water
an&rsquo; nothin&rsquo; else, an&rsquo; is to larn to take de sun

<p>&ldquo;Ef you kotch one stealin&rsquo; gin, make a rope
fas&rsquo; to him an&rsquo; t&rsquo;ow him oberboard all day
long.&nbsp; Ef he don&rsquo;t die de fust day, try him
ag&rsquo;in de second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gittin&rsquo; away wid w&rsquo;isky is bery bad. Ef a
cook or stoord is foun&rsquo; out, he mus&rsquo; be drove full
o&rsquo; marling-spikes till he stops yellin&rsquo;, eben ef it
done kills him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But ef one steals brandy,&mdash;wahl, der ain&rsquo;t
nothin&rsquo; bad &rsquo;nough fur him.&nbsp; Brandy is awful
hard to make, an&rsquo; costs a hun&rsquo;red dollahs a
poun&rsquo;; so &rsquo;tain&rsquo;t no sort o&rsquo; use
foolin&rsquo; with one dat steals it.&nbsp; De craf&rsquo; will

innocent man, an&rsquo; his wages is to be made biggah. Heah de
chaptah ends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Prince made this up as he went along, pronouncing his words
with much gravity, and it had such an effect on Cornwallis that
we had all we could do to keep from roaring right out.&nbsp; We
had to look solemn, though, or he would have smelt a rat.&nbsp;
He stood with his back against the wall, rolling up the whites of
his eyes and looking around in a scared way as if he didn&rsquo;t
know whether the whole thing was a joke or not.&nbsp; Finally he
said: &ldquo;Cap&rsquo;n Pratt, I axes you, sah, ef what dat
niggah done read is wrote down in dat book, or is I bein&rsquo;
made a wictim ob what dey calls de
cu&rsquo;cumstances?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all down in cold type, Cornwallis, and
now we must put you to the test, so as to know if you&rsquo;re
guilty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What test am dat, sah?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, we must hang a grindstone round your neck and
heave you overboard.&nbsp; If you didn&rsquo;t steal the brandy,
you&rsquo;ll float. That&rsquo;s what the book says.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cook&rsquo;s jaw dropped, and he fell down in a
heap.&nbsp; Throwing his arms around Pratt&rsquo;s knees, he
gasped: &ldquo;Does yo&rsquo; mean dat, Cap&rsquo;n?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pratt nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, fur de good Lawd&rsquo;s sake, what hab dis pore
chile done dat he mus&rsquo; be kilt in cole blood!&nbsp;
Ain&rsquo;t I sarved you, sah, fur one, two, six,&mdash;wahl,

blood-thu&rsquo;sty niggah what&rsquo;s been hankerin&rsquo;
arter my life&mdash;is yo&rsquo; gwine to let him murdah
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel sorry for you, Cornwallis,&mdash;d&mdash;n me if
I don&rsquo;t,&mdash;but there&rsquo;s no help for it.&nbsp; The
book says the craft will never reach port if the guilty person
escapes, so it&rsquo;s a case of your going overboard or all of
us giving up the ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>&ldquo;Gents, is der no marcy in yo&rsquo;
buzums?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This piteous appeal was addressed to Warriner and me, and the
cook looked so miserable that I could hardly play my part.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, you must prepare for the ordeal,&rdquo; said
Warriner, &ldquo;and if you have told the truth you will surely
float.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, an&rsquo; a grin&rsquo;stone made fas&rsquo; to
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mass&rsquo; Warmer, I&rsquo;s not ready to die;
&rsquo;deed I&rsquo;s not.&nbsp; I&rsquo;s been powe&rsquo;ful
wicked in my time, an&rsquo; dem kin&rsquo; o&rsquo; people has
to jine de chu&rsquo;ch an&rsquo; hab r&rsquo;ligion &rsquo;fore
deh heahs de trumpet blow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more fooling.&nbsp; Prince, you bring aft the
grindstone that the crew sharpen their knives on.&nbsp; Hunt, you
get the fog-horn and blow like h&mdash; when we heave him
overboard.&nbsp; The d&mdash;d thing makes more noise than any
trumpet I ever heard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; added Warriner, &ldquo;It may comfort the
condemned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we got back with the horn and grindstone, Cornwallis was
jumping up and down and yelling like a maniac.</p>
<p><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s de culprit!&nbsp; I&rsquo;s de
culprit!&nbsp; I&rsquo;s de culprit!&nbsp; An&rsquo; ef yo&rsquo;

an&rsquo; I&rsquo;ll go into one ob dem conbents whar dey is said
to be dead to de worl&rsquo;, an&rsquo; I won&rsquo;t nebber see
none ob yo&rsquo; no moah.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sinner owns up,&rdquo; cried Pratt, and Prince
grinned till every one of his ivories showed. &ldquo;Now,
Cornwallis, your life will be spared on condition that you make a
clean breast of this matter.&nbsp; No more lies; and you must pay
for the brandy you drank at the rate of one hundred dollars a
gallon&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t that it, Prince?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A hun&rsquo;red dollahs a poun&rsquo;, sah,&rdquo;
corrected Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I doan know how many poun&rsquo; I drank,&rdquo;
sniffed the cook, &ldquo;an&rsquo; ef I has to pay dat much fur
each one ob &rsquo;em, I&rsquo;s got to wo&rsquo;k more&rsquo;n a
year fur nothin&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better than being drowned to-day,&rdquo;
said I, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;d better be thankful.&nbsp; Now tell
us how you took the brandy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s been close to de dahk riber, gents,
an&rsquo; will perceed to tell de truf,&rdquo; said Cornwallis,
now much relieved after his narrow escape.&nbsp; He looked down
at the floor and began in a low tone: &ldquo;Yo&rsquo; see, it
was jes&rsquo; dis way.&nbsp; Mass&rsquo; Warmer, he done brung
de brandy an&rsquo; say, &lsquo;Put some ob dat in de sass
an&rsquo; some roun&rsquo; de puddin&rsquo;.&rsquo;&nbsp; De
las&rsquo; was to be sot on fire soon as &rsquo;twas on de

<p>&ldquo;Wahl, I was stan&rsquo;in&rsquo; lookin&rsquo; at de
bottle when I heerd a noise.&nbsp; I turn roun&rsquo;, an&rsquo;
as shuah as I lib, ef de debil wahn&rsquo;t right &rsquo;side ob

he looks like, jes&rsquo; take a good look at dat Prince
Sahnders, fur ef him an&rsquo; de debil ain&rsquo;t brudders
I&rsquo;m a cod-fish!</p>
<p>&ldquo;I says, &lsquo;Debil, go &rsquo;way.&nbsp; I doan want
no trouble wid you.&rsquo;&nbsp; But he gib me.a push
towa&rsquo;ds de bottle, and says, reel soft-like,
&lsquo;Yo&rsquo; pore, mis&rsquo;able, skinny, oberwo&rsquo;ked
critter, you&rsquo;s all fadin&rsquo; away.&rsquo;&nbsp;
(Cornwallis weighed at least two hundred.)&nbsp; &rsquo;Dere

an&rsquo; bone.&nbsp; Jes&rsquo; take a drap ob dat liquor,
an&rsquo; it mought do lots ob good. You&rsquo;s gittin&rsquo;
ole, and needs some stimilant.&rsquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I knowed it was de gospel truf, yo&rsquo;
understan&rsquo;, but at de same time it wahn&rsquo;t right,
an&rsquo; I tried to put ole Nick out ob de galley.&nbsp; He wahr
bigger den me, an&rsquo; jes&rsquo; made me drink dat brandy till
de bottle looked a&rsquo;most empty.&nbsp; &rsquo;Deed I tried to
git him out, but &rsquo;twan&rsquo;t no use, an&rsquo; ebery drap
ob dat liquor done wanished &rsquo;fore he quit pesterin&rsquo;
me.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d had a misery in my head de hull
mawnin&rsquo;, but I felt right pert arter de brandy was
gone.&nbsp; I sot down to reflec&rsquo; a spell.</p>
<p>&ldquo;&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; I says, &lsquo;ef de brandy was to
be sot fire to an&rsquo; burned up, it am plain dat it
can&rsquo;t be drank.&rsquo;&nbsp; I &rsquo;lowed dat keerosene
ansahs de pu&rsquo;pose jes&rsquo; as well, so I puts it
roun&rsquo; de puddin&rsquo;.&nbsp; Golly! how dat ile did
burn!&nbsp; I was real dis&rsquo;pinted &rsquo;bout de sass, fur
I reckoned dat ile mought pizen yo&rsquo;. So I lef&rsquo; it
out, an&rsquo; hoped dat fak&rsquo; would &rsquo;scape de

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;s spoke de truf, yo&rsquo; understan&rsquo;,
an&rsquo; is <a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>resolbed to die &rsquo;fore I eber agin disto&rsquo;ts
de fak&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We all laughed till we nearly parted our braces, especially
Warriner.&nbsp; I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed he had so much
humor. The passenger pulled away the tablecloth and the smashed
crockery till he sighted the pudding.&nbsp; What with the smell
of oil and burned feathers, and being all scorched up and stepped
on, it wasn&rsquo;t a very fine sight by this time.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did any of you ever read &lsquo;Great
Expectations?&rsquo;&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>None of us had.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It tells of a certain lady called Miss Havisham, who
expected to be married one evening.&nbsp; The wedding supper was
spread and everything ready, but the bridegroom never came.&nbsp;
For years and years after did Miss Havisham keep that feast
untouched in the deserted room&mdash;kept it until spiders spun
webs over it, and mice and damp played havoc with the faded
yellow cloth and the viands.&nbsp; Sometimes a boy named Pip
would pay her a visit, and then the wax tapers would be <a
name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>lighted,
while the strange pair walked round and round the decaying
feast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so, my friends, should I preserve this pudding and
enthrone it in my Brooklyn home to remind me of my lost brandy
and of this most extraordinary Thanksgiving.&nbsp; But that is
impossible, so follow me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked the pudding up from the floor and held it out at
arm&rsquo;s length, at the same time leading the way out on
deck.&nbsp; Sunday and Tuesday, Flip and Jackson and all the crew
forgot what they were about at sight of the queer procession, and
Warriner holding out the pudding.&nbsp; He marched over to the
lee bulwarks, got on top of an empty box, and began to look at
the pudding with a very sorrowful expression, his eyes blinking
and his head on one side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil is he about?&rdquo; thinks I.</p>
<p>He looked around at us and wiped his eyes with a silk
handkerchief; then held out the blasted pudding in both hands so
all of us could see it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, behold!&nbsp; This was a plum-pudding.&nbsp;
Yea, thou dark and sodden mass, pierced with feathers and
baptized <a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>in kerosene; thou culinary triumph, concocted by Samuel
Warriner and the descendant of Lord Cornwallis;&mdash;thou fond
inspiration of our brain, which, owing to the combined assaults
of Satan and yon sable African, hast so abominably miscarried; we
bid thee an eternal farewell!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good G&mdash;, if he ain&rsquo;t blubbering!&rdquo;
whispered Pratt, while Warriner looked so affected that Prince,
Cornwallis and me nearly cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-by, pudding.&nbsp; Go-od-b-bye,&rdquo; (heaving it
overboard) &ldquo;and be thou food for worms&mdash;I should say,
fishes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Away it went, and struck the water with a splash.&nbsp; All
hands stared until it sunk, and then we looked at Warriner. He
had taken up the fog-horn, and just as the pudding went under, he
blew a mournful blast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May the dear departed rest in peace,&rdquo; he said,
feelingly.</p>
<p>Then we all pulled ourselves together and went back to
work.</p>

</a>Alice and I were seated at the breakfast-table in our
rambling old house on the outskirts of the French quarter in New
Orleans.&nbsp; She was glancing over the <i>Picayune</i>, while I
was wrapped in deep thought concerning the most vivid and
remarkable dream I had ever had,&mdash;the strangest part being
that it was about a place I had never seen or even heard
of.&nbsp; My sister, who had never married, was ten years my
junior, and after my wife&rsquo;s death, Alice had accepted my
invitation to take charge of my household.&nbsp; We lived a
retired life, with no one else in the big house but a
maid-servant and old <a name="page58"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 58</span>black Bilbo, a trusted domestic, who
had been a slave in our family during the halcyon days before the
war.&nbsp; &ldquo;Alice,&rdquo; said I, suddenly, &ldquo;I have
concluded to take Dr. Antoine&rsquo;s advice, and go off on a sea
voyage.&nbsp; You remember the last time he prescribed for me, he
said my poor health was simply the result of overwork and too
close attention to business, and that a long voyage would benefit
me more than anything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My sister laid aside her paper, both surprised and
pleased.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How glad I am, George, that you at last see the
necessity of it.&nbsp; Where shall you go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, according to my dream of the last two nights, my
destination will be latitude 3&deg; 50&prime; 30&Prime; South,
longitude 32&deg; 24&prime; 30&Prime; West.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alice stared at me as though she doubted my sanity, while I
folded my arms, nodded my head, and tried not to look
foolish.</p>
<p>I waited a moment, thinking she would speak, and then
continued: &ldquo;Yes, I know <a name="page59"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 59</span>you will say that a man forty-three
years old ought to know better, especially so prosaic a one as
you often say I am.&nbsp; But let me tell you my vision, and then
ridicule it if you can.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Night before last I slept unusually well, and was
conscious of nothing until I heard a clock somewhere strike
four.&nbsp; I dozed off soon after, and had this dream:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was seated alone in the stern of a little boat, that
floated on a calm and gently-heaving moonlit sea; while close on
my right hand was a small, densely wooded island, with
phosphorescent waves breaking upon its sandy beach.&nbsp; Behind
it, and belonging seemingly to another body of land, a lofty peak
towered into the air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The silvery white light fell upon a stately palm that
grew near a large rock on the islet, and upon two figures, one of
whom, in military uniform, leaned against the trunk, while the
other carefully smoothed over the ground at the base of the
tree.&nbsp; Then the former glided to the rock and wrote or
scratched something <a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>upon it, but though I looked and looked, I saw no words,
nor could I get even the smallest view of the faces of the two
men, although their figures were perfectly plain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While striving to see their features, I became sensible
of a veil of mist enveloping both land and sea, and when it
passed, island and peak were gone.&nbsp; In their stead was a
gigantic blackboard rising out of the ocean, with these
characters upon it, in figures and letters so large that they
terrified me:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p style="text-align: center">3&deg;&nbsp; 50&prime;
30&Prime; S.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">32&deg;&nbsp; 24&prime; 30&Prime;
W.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>&ldquo;As I looked, the great object seemed to advance upon
me&mdash;I should be annihilated!&nbsp; I tried to grasp an oar
in the bottom of the boat, but could not move a muscle.&nbsp; On
it came, rapidly, noiselessly.&nbsp; At the instant it was upon
me, I made a frantic lunge and found myself sitting up in bed,
drenched in perspiration, and my heart beating so I could hardly
breathe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On realizing where I was, I got up, <a
name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>struck a
match, and looked at my watch.&nbsp; A quarter past four!&nbsp;
All that had happened since I heard the clock strike fifteen
minutes before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I said nothing to you yesterday, Alice, but now you
know why I have been so preoccupied.&nbsp; Again last night I had
the same dream.&rdquo;</p>
<p>My sister said little, except to advise me to dismiss the
whole subject from my mind, but I could see that it had made more
of an impression on her than she chose to admit.</p>
<p>I had already consulted the atlas in regard to the spot of
which I had dreamed, and found it to be an island with an
unpronouncable name, lying near the coast of Brazil.</p>
<p>That night I wrote to my nephew Ralph at New York, telling him
that I had decided to take a sea voyage, and asking him what was
the best way of getting to Fernando de Noronha, for that was the
name of the island.&nbsp; He was master, and one-third owner of
the brig <i>Sea Witch</i>, and I knew his advice was to be
depended on.</p>
<p><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>I was
very busy for several days following, arranging my business
affairs and giving certain necessary directions to my partner,
Simon LaForte.&nbsp; Each night I retired fully expecting a
repetition of the dream, but my expectations were not
realized.</p>
<p>Ralph&rsquo;s answer came Saturday.&nbsp; Here it is:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Dear Uncle
George</span>,&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours of the 9th received.&nbsp; I am glad you&rsquo;ve
concluded to go to sea, but what possesses you to steer for
Fernando de Noronha?&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a Brazilian convict island
one hundred miles from the coast, where all the life prisoners
are confined, and except the government transports, not a vessel
stops at the place for months together.&nbsp; There is absolutely
nothing there but a fertile island of about twenty square miles,
inhabited only by convicts, soldiers, and a governor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Sea Witch</i> has been chartered to load for
Pernambuco, and from there will come back to New York.&nbsp; Now
uncle, take my advice and go along.&nbsp; The only <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>way to see
the ocean as it really is, is on a sailing vessel, and we shall
probably sight this island of yours either going or returning,
which ought to satisfy you.&nbsp; You would have a good time as a
passenger, but as you&rsquo;ve always been such a worker, it
might not suit you to loaf, and in that case you could ship
before the mast.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll show you how to make sennit,
mouse blocks, overhaul buntlines, tie a reef-point, and do other
things you never heard of.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brig is repairing at Poillon&rsquo;s yard.&nbsp; We
had a rough passage from Tampico, and the little hooker had a
couple of sticks jerked out in a blow off Hatteras.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;re in New York in three weeks it will be
time enough.&nbsp; I must run over to South Street now, so
good-bye.&nbsp; Love to yourself and Aunt Alice.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">&ldquo;<span
class="smcap">Ralph</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This epistle I read aloud, and we both laughed over
Ralph&rsquo;s joke about my shipping before the mast, but that
part of the letter referring to the sticks being jerked out of
the brig made me feel rather dubious.&nbsp; I consoled myself,
however, by <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>reflecting that such things probably did not occur
often, and after long deliberation decided to go, and wrote Ralph
to that effect.</p>
<p>It was the afternoon of July 2 that the tug <i>Charm</i>
pulled the brig out from Pier 1, East River, and took her in tow
for Sandy Hook.&nbsp; It is a long tow, and the stars were
shining when the pilot went over the side, the tug&rsquo;s hawser
was cast off, and we were left to shift for ourselves.</p>
<p>Everyone aboard was so busy that I did not get a chance to say
half a dozen words to Ralph that night.&nbsp; He and the mate
were roaring out orders; the yards were being hoisted to the
accompaniment of the wild sailors&rsquo; chant, which begins
&ldquo;From South Street slip to &rsquo;Frisco Bay,&rdquo; and I
finally turned in and slept sounder than I had for months, in
spite of the racket on deck. Next morning was beautiful, and we
were spinning along at a great rate when I came on deck.&nbsp; I
felt fine, but somehow couldn&rsquo;t walk very well.&nbsp; Ralph
told me the names of the sails and some of the <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>ropes, and
was surprised that I hadn&rsquo;t been sick.</p>
<p>Before we sailed, I had told him my dream, which he ridiculed
until I spoke of the lofty peak, when he became serious.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is just such a peak at one end of the
island,&rdquo; he had said.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is eight hundred feet
high, and the observatory at its summit overlooks the island, and
the ocean for sixty miles in every direction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was enough for me to know; I was now determined at any
cost to get ashore on that island and try and find the scene
pictured in my vision, for that such a scene existed I no longer
doubted.</p>
<p>Three weeks passed, and we had made good progress since
leaving port.&nbsp; I soon found my sea legs, as Ralph expressed
it, and often climbed the rigging as far as the tops.&nbsp; I
went out on the jibboom and caught bonitas&mdash;a deep-sea fish
of a steely blue color which preys remorselessly upon the
flying-fish; I read; I learned to make nautical knots of various
kinds, and actually felt ten years younger than I had in New
Orleans.&nbsp; There was nothing to <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>bother or irritate me; no telephones,
no whistles blowing, no mail to open, no newspapers to read; in a
word, I was in a new world altogether, and began to get so fat
that Seth Hawkins, the mate, one day told me that I should have
to shake a reef or two out of my clothes by the time I got back
to New York.</p>
<p>After a particularly fine day&rsquo;s run, I said to Ralph,
who had just marked it on the chart, &ldquo;I had no idea that
sailing vessels could go fast.&nbsp; As this rate we shall soon
be across the Equator.&nbsp; You say we are only 8&deg; North
this noon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t crow, uncle, till we&rsquo;re through the
Doldrums,&rdquo; he replied. I had heard a little about this
bugbear, but had a rather vague idea as to what sort of a place
it was. I was soon to know, for upon going on deck next morning,
I found a dead calm. There was not even enough wind to steer
by.&nbsp; The atmosphere was hot and muggy, while great masses of
wet-looking clouds were piled up all along the horizon.&nbsp; The
sails flapped against the masts and rigging <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>with loud
reports each time the brig rolled, and when I saluted Seth
Hawkins, he said: &ldquo;Well, Mr. Spencer, how do you like the
Doldrums?&rdquo;</p>
<p>During the forenoon a violent rain squall struck us from due
South, and we tore along at a nine-knot rate, while such torrents
of rain I never saw before.&nbsp; Barrels were put in position to
catch the water, but before noon the rain ceased suddenly and the
wind with it.&nbsp; Thus it was all that day, all the next day,
and for a whole week,&mdash;nothing but calms, rain-squalls, and
variable winds (usually from the wrong direction), until I was
nearly beside myself.&nbsp; Some days we made less than thirty
miles in the twenty-four hours, and it was no unusual occurrence
to tack ship three, and even four times a day, which put Ralph
and the mate in a horrible humor.</p>
<p>But there is an end to all things, and on the twenty-ninth day
out we crossed the line with a fair wind, and when Ralph figured
out our position the next noon, he <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>announced that we should probably be
in Pernambuco inside of three days.</p>
<p>After much persuasion, I induced him to promise to stop at
Fernando de Noronha on the way back long enough for me to go
ashore, for the wind we now had would carry us a long way inside
the island, and we should not even sight it. Three days later the
first half of our journey was completed, and we were safely in
port after a good passage of thirty-four days.</p>
<p>I found much to interest me in Pernambuco.&nbsp; The harbor
was crowded with shipping, amongst which the British and
Norwegian flags predominated; but my eyes were gladdened quite
frequently by the sight of the stars and stripes. The head
stevedore, who had charge of loading the brig, was a half-breed
named Pedro.&nbsp; He spoke very fair English, and during one of
our frequent talks, I casually mentioned Fernando de Noronha.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Diabalo!&rdquo; he exclaimed, his black eyes
glittering, &ldquo;My brother&mdash;poor Manuel&mdash;he is
there!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>&ldquo;Why, is he a prisoner?&rdquo; I asked in
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What for else should he be there?&rdquo; he replied,
shrugging his shoulders.&nbsp; &ldquo;Santa Maria! he will never
come back.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then he related the story of Manuel, after which, by a little
questioning, I found that Pedro knew several things about the
island of interest to me.&nbsp; He said that occasionally, when
vessels were becalmed there, a boat was sent ashore for melons,
which grew in great abundance on a very small island near the
larger one.&nbsp; A suit of clothes or a sack of flour would buy
more melons than would go in the boat.</p>
<p>We were thirty-one days in Pernambuco discharging and
reloading, but at last the stores were on board and everything
ready, and the day before sailing, I accompanied Ralph to the
Custom House to &ldquo;clear the brig.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We put to sea on Monday afternoon, and at daybreak next
morning the convict island should be in sight, if the wind held
at northwest.&nbsp; I was much excited, now that my hopes were so
near <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>fruition, for that something of value was concealed at
the foot of the palm tree I did not doubt; else why had I dreamed
of this out-of-the-way spot, of which I had never even heard?</p>
<p>That night we consulted together, and carefully matured our
plans, for Ralph had come to take nearly as much interest in the
outcome of the affair as I.&nbsp; He refused to go ashore
himself, saying that it was against all custom for a captain ever
to leave his vessel while she was on a voyage, but that Seth
Hawkins and two of the crew should go in the boat with us.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now, Uncle,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;please
realize one thing.&nbsp; In putting off a boat, I shall be doing
something I&rsquo;d do for no one but you, as it is the duty of a
captain to take his vessel from one port to another without any
unnecessary delay.&nbsp; So don&rsquo;t lose any time on the
island, for I shall feel guilty as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I grasped his hand warmly, and whispered: &ldquo;Ralph, if I
am any richer to-morrow night than I am now, you shall profit by
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>He
smiled, and said: &ldquo;By the way, I shall have to let Hawkins
into the affair to a limited extent, for he knows very well
I&rsquo;d not send ashore simply to get melons.&nbsp; He&rsquo;s
been with me two years, and can be trusted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Eight bells struck; the second dog-watch was over, and Ralph
went below to turn in, while Seth Hawkins and I paced the deck
together,&mdash;he telling me some interesting reminiscences of
his life in Hong Kong, where he had once kept a sailors&rsquo;
boarding house.</p>
<p>I rose very early next morning; in fact, it was but little
past sunrise, and the crew had not finished &ldquo;washing
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mate was standing by the starboard taffrail, and after the
usual &ldquo;Good morning,&rdquo; he was about to speak, when I
exclaimed, pointing to the east, &ldquo;Look! what great
lighthouse is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had just seen it,&mdash;a distant outline clearly defined
against the rosy eastern sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no lighthouse, though it does look like
one.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the peak on your island.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 72</span>The
last words were spoken with so peculiar an emphasis that I knew
Ralph had told him our plans.&nbsp; He went forward, and I
continued to devour that majestic peak, that gradually lost its
shadowy appearance and assumed definite form.</p>
<p>The wind was light, and we raised it slowly.&nbsp; As I
looked, a feeling of bewilderment stole over me.&nbsp; There was
the peak of my dream to a certainty, and yet something was
lacking.&nbsp; There should have been an island in front of
it.</p>
<p>At two bells in the forenoon watch we could distinguish
objects on shore.&nbsp; For some time past I had noticed a small
islet near the main one, and as we continued to sail on, we
gradually brought it between us and the peak on Fernando de
Noronha. Then I recognized it all.</p>
<p>Ralph spoke to me, but I was speechless with emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rouse yourself,&rdquo; I at last heard him say;
&ldquo;In half an hour it will be time to launch the
boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Those words restored me, and I went below to make my
preparations.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><a name="page73"></a><span

</a></p>
<p>The boat was hoisted into the air by means of a bowline rigged
over the fore yard-arm, and was then lowered over the side.&nbsp;
Hawkins, a couple of hands, and myself entered it.</p>
<p>I noticed that instead of heading for Wood Island, as Ralph
called it, we were making for Fernando de Noronha itself.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where are we going, Mr. Hawkins?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to get permission of the Governor, Mr.
Spencer, before we can carry off any melons, or even land on that
island,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>A number of soldiers were gathered about the rude quay,
evidently much surprised to see a vessel stop at the
island.&nbsp; When the mate and I stepped ashore, a distinguished
looking man whom we had not seen before came forward and said
something in Spanish, which I did not understand.&nbsp; Hawkins
did, and bowed with a grace which I had never suspected him of
possessing; and I knew that this was the Governor.</p>
<p>The mate possessed some knowledge of <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>Spanish, and
finally managed to make himself understood.&nbsp; The Governor
evidently took him for the master of the brig, as the two
addressed each other respectively as &ldquo;Senor El
Capitan&rdquo; and &ldquo;Excellenza,&rdquo; which was all I
could understand.</p>
<p>At a signal from the mate, one of our men brought a sack of
flour from the boat, and we prepared to embark.&nbsp; Two of the
soldiers advanced to the boat with us, and I saw them exchange
glances of surprise. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve seen that spade and
pick-axe, the rascals!&rdquo; said Seth, aside to me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got leave to get all the melons we want,&rdquo;
he continued, as the men pulled away for the landing, &ldquo;but
that smirking Governor was a sight too polite and inquisitive to
suit me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Wood Island is separated from Fernando de Noronha by a narrow
channel, but Hawkins ordered his men to row around a point of
land, to be out of sight from the quay, which was then something
over a mile distant.</p>
<p>After grounding on the beach, a little wave carried us further
up, and we all <a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>leaped out.&nbsp; Seth dispatched the two men towards
the north end of the islet after melons, and as soon as they were
out of the way, we grasped our tools and commenced the search for
the rock, which ought to be near the shore.</p>
<p>We followed the beach all along that side of the islet, Seth
eying me curiously, and occasionally admonishing me to
&ldquo;Look out for centipedes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Near the southern extremity, I came to a palm that seemed to
me identical with the one of my dream, but not a solitary rock
was there near it.&nbsp; After considerably more than an hour had
elapsed, the mate ventured the remark that our prolonged stay on
the island might arouse suspicion in the Governor&rsquo;s mind,
especially if the soldiers told him of the spade and pick-axe in
the boat.</p>
<p>I had seated myself on the decaying trunk of a fallen tree to
rest a moment, and wonder if my expedition was to result in
failure, but at Hawkins&rsquo; words I started up.</p>
<p>I advanced towards a mango tree to <a name="page76"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 76</span>refresh myself with some of the ripe
fruit, when, through an opening in the underbrush, <i>I saw
it</i>&mdash;the rock of my dream at last!</p>
<p>There could be no doubt of it.&nbsp; I breathlessly
approached, and touched it with the spade.</p>
<p>This is what was scratched on the broad surface, in characters
quite fresh and distinct: &ldquo;Mas distante
occidente.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Further west,&rdquo; said Hawkins, behind me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that what it means in English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He nodded, and I turned to find the palm, which should be only
a short way to the left.</p>
<p>Could this be it&mdash;this blasted trunk, looking as though
lightning had struck it?&nbsp; Judging from its position it must
be, and making a sign to Seth, we fell to with pick and
spade.</p>
<p>We worked until I thought my back would break, and must have
dug down more than three feet in the rich soil, when the spade
struck an obstruction, and we heard the muffled grating of
metal.&nbsp; Then <a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>the top of what seemed a small zinc box was
uncovered.</p>
<p>Silently we toiled away, and within ten minutes more were able
to drag forth the box from its resting place.</p>
<p>It was perhaps a foot square, and weighed so much that Seth
and I took turns in lugging it along the beach towards the
boat.&nbsp; Upon arriving there, I wrapped the box in a piece of
tarpaulin, that the men might not see what it was, and placed it
in the boat.</p>
<p>We saw nothing of our crew, but the sight of nearly a dozen
immense water-melons laid on the beach proved that they had not
been idle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great Scott!&nbsp; I s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;d bring
melons for a week if I didn&rsquo;t yell
&lsquo;Belay!&rsquo;&rdquo; ejaculated Seth; &ldquo;how many do
they think the boat can hold?&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve got to hunt them
up, for Captain Spencer wants no time wasted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He disappeared, and I occupied myself in devouring the box
with my eyes, and speculating as to its contents.&nbsp; What
fabulous wealth in gold and jewels was hidden <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>away in that
dull casket?&nbsp; Millions, possibly.&nbsp; In what century had
it been buried? Through what scores and scores of years had this
little islet been the hiding-place of the ancient box I now
looked on?&nbsp; All other eyes that had beheld it must have long
since mouldered into dust.</p>
<p>While absorbed in these reflections relating to the past, I
was rudely recalled to the present by a crashing in the
underbrush, and Seth Hawkins, with our men, appeared, running
towards the boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lay aboard lively there, Mr. Spencer!&rdquo; cried the
mate.</p>
<p>Much alarmed, I tumbled in, and he followed a moment
later.&nbsp; The men, a Scandinavian and a negro, were about to
put some of the melons into the boat, when Seth cried,
&ldquo;Drop &rsquo;em, and pile in here, you sons of
sea-cooks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>They obeyed, and shoved off the boat, though greatly
bewildered at leaving the island without the very fruit we had
ostensibly come after.&nbsp; The oars were plied vigorously, and
when about a ship&rsquo;s length from the beach, I espied a <a
name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 79</span>catamaran <a
name="citation79"></a><a href="#footnote79"
class="citation">[79]</a> coming around the north end of the
islet.</p>
<p>The truth burst upon us.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are followed!&rdquo;
I exclaimed.&nbsp; Seth nodded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&nbsp; Did the Governor not give us permission to
land?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true; but those dark-skinned devils that
saw the spade and pick-axe like enough told him, and he&rsquo;s
bound to see what we&rsquo;re up to.&nbsp; If they overhaul this
boat, and see that box of yours, and find we&rsquo;ve got no
melons, there&rsquo;ll be trouble.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d have brought
off a few, but they&rsquo;d weigh the boat down too much. These
Brazilians have no use for Americans, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Our situation was certainly unpleasant. We were nearly a mile
from the brig, and the catamaran was not over half that <a
name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 80</span>distance
astern of us, and running dead before the wind, which was
freshening.&nbsp; I was beginning to wonder what Ralph could be
doing, for he actually seemed to be going away from us, when the
mate cried out: &ldquo;Look! the brig&rsquo;s in stays! the
Captain&rsquo;s putting her about, so as to fetch us on the
starboard tack.&nbsp; Hurray!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Five minutes later, the <i>Sea Witch</i>, with the wind abeam,
was running down to us at nearly right angles, evidently aiming
to go between us and our pursuers, who were now hardly a quarter
of a mile astern.&nbsp; We easily made out five people on the
catamaran, two of whom Seth thought were convicts, while one of
the others he took for the Governor himself.&nbsp; The latter was
waving something in a hostile manner, but as the brig was going
six feet to the catamaran&rsquo;s one, we no longer felt alarm
unless our pursuers should use fire-arms.</p>
<p>The brig&rsquo;s helm was now put down, and she shot up into
the wind, thus checking her progress; when halyards were let go,
and the light sails came fluttering in.&nbsp; We were only a
couple of cable lengths away, <a name="page81"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 81</span>and soon had the boat alongside, and
my newly acquired property aboard.</p>
<p>The catamaran had given up the pursuit, and was on her way
back to the island, those on board indulging in violent
gesticulations as long as we could distinguish them.</p>
<p>Some time later, we were closeted in Ralph&rsquo;s room (which
was much larger than mine) with the box between us.&nbsp; It was
necessary to bring tools from the carpenter shop to open it, and
the first discovery we made was that the zinc was simply the
covering for a wooden box, which my nephew said was made of teak,
one of the rarest and most durable of woods.&nbsp; It was lined
with sailcloth, and upon drawing this aside we saw a small
crucifix.&nbsp; Beneath this was a folded paper, and then&mdash;a
golden vision!</p>
<p>For one moment we stared at it in silence, when I stretched
out my hand and took up a coin, half expecting to see it melt
away.&nbsp; It bore the embossed head of Dom Pedro, and the date
1885, besides an inscription.</p>
<p><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>&ldquo;Ha, this is modern!&rdquo; I exclaimed, much
surprised at the recent date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Ralph, as I prepared to turn out the
contents of the box, &ldquo;let me read this paper; it is in
Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This 34,000 M. is the property of Leon da Costa,
Commander of His Imperial Majesty&rsquo;s troops at Pernambuco,
by whom it was here concealed September 16, 1889, pending the
settlement of the dissentions which are now rending our unhappy
country, and which make it unsafe for one enjoying the favor of
the noble Dom Pedro to own property in Brazil.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Invoking the blessing of the church, and the protection
of Holy Mary, I here commit my all to Mother Earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neither of us spoke for a minute.&nbsp; I felt awed, as though
a voice from another world had spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ralph,&rdquo; I said, slowly, &ldquo;if I had known
this treasure had been here but two years, and belonged to a man
who is probably still living, I should never have taken it. As it
is, I shall keep it until inquiries are <a
name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>made, but it
shall not be used except in the event of this man&rsquo;s
death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ralph bowed his head in acquiescence.</p>
<p>The milreis is the standard coin of Brazil, as I learned at
Pernambuco, and is worth about fifty-five cents in our money, so
that the box contained nearly $18,700, some of which was in
currency.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Da Costa,&rdquo; said Ralph, &ldquo;evidently had
the duty of conducting the convicts from Pernambuco to the
island; and it was doubtless on one of these trips that he buried
his money, though why he has let it remain so long puzzles
me.&nbsp; And as for &lsquo;Mas distante occidente,&rsquo; which
you say was traced on the rock, the words were probably written
as a guide to the location of the tree.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The convict island faded away in the distance, the great peak
being visible for several hours after all other parts had
vanished; and that evening, long after the damp night-wind had
stiffened the sails, and a drenching dew lay heavy on the
bulwarks, I stood watching the glorious phosphorescent display in
the brig&rsquo;s wake, <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>and marvelling over the strange
fulfillment of my dream.</p>
<p>The inquiries which we instituted upon my return home resulted
in the discovery that Leon Da Costa had died of yellow fever in
1890 at Santos, one of the chief ports of Brazil, and at the same
time about the most pestilential and unsanitary place on the face
of the earth.&nbsp; I had no further scruples about using the
money, $5,000 of which I sent to Ralph, without whose assistance
I should have accomplished nothing.&nbsp; He now owns two-thirds
of the brig <i>Sea Witch</i>, of which vessel Seth Hawkins is
still mate.</p>

</a>The West India hurricane of August, 1893, was one of unusual
severity, and caused great havoc among shipping on the Atlantic
seaboard from Florida to Maine.&nbsp; Besides the large number of
vessels lost by going ashore, many were abandoned by their crews
at sea after having sprung a leak or become water-logged.&nbsp; A
large part of these craft subsequently foundered, but a number of
them were vessels bound from Georgia ports to Boston and New York
with cargoes of hard pine lumber, and in these cases the vessels,
after becoming full of water, &ldquo;floated on their
cargoes;&rdquo; that is to say, the buoyancy imparted to the <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>wrecks by the
lumber in their holds kept them from sinking as they ordinarily
would have done.&nbsp; Some of these derelicts have been known to
float for a year or two, round and round in a beaten track,
forming a source of great peril to navigation; until, the lumber
becoming thoroughly saturated with water, the wreck finally
sinks.&nbsp; In some instances the abandoned vessel is torn to
pieces by the violence of successive storms before this stage has
been reached.</p>
<p>The most remarkable case of this character is that of the
American schooner <i>Fannie E. Wolston</i>, which was abandoned
at sea in October, 1891, and was still afloat three years
afterward.&nbsp; She was sighted scores of times during this long
interval, and was more than once set on fire by passing
vessels.&nbsp; Her travels brought her from Cape Hatteras to
mid-ocean; from the tropical Bahamas nearly to the shores of
Europe; and in almost every part of the North Atlantic she was
frequently seen.&nbsp; Covered with barnacles and sea-weed,
reduced to a mere skeleton, <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>and with one rusty anchor still
hanging from her bow, this celebrated derelict continued for
thirty-six months her long pilgrimage without captain or
crew.&nbsp; The bitter gales of three Atlantic winters, that
disposed of the ill-fated Naronic and a hundred other staunch
vessels were unable to sink the Fannie E. Wolston.&nbsp; When
last seen in September, 1894, she had nearly completed the third
year of her phenomenal career as an abandoned wreck, during which
long period it is computed that her drift was more than eight
thousand miles.&nbsp; She was the record-breaker of
derelicts.</p>
<p>A sailing ship arrived at Philadelphia early in September,
having on board the captain and crew of the brig Neptune, which
had been abandoned four days previously, two hundred miles east
of Cape Hatteras, while on a voyage from Savannah to Boston with
a cargo of Georgia pine.&nbsp; Within a month the brig was
sighted no less than five times by steamers arriving at New
York&mdash;the last time being in Lat. 42&deg; N., Long. 65&deg;
W., a point <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>several hundred miles directly east from Boston.&nbsp;
Thus in four weeks this derelict had drifted nearly six hundred
miles to the northeast of the spot where she was abandoned.</p>
<p>Nothing having been done towards recovering her, at the
expiration of a month the owners of the powerful ocean tug
<i>Atlas</i>, of Philadelphia, determined to despatch that vessel
in search of the <i>Neptune</i>; for, could the latter be brought
into port, the owners of the tug would reap a profitable harvest
in the way of salvage.</p>
<p>Accordingly, one fine autumn morning, the <i>Atlas</i> steamed
out from the Point Breeze Oil Wharves on the Schuylkill River,
with a three weeks&rsquo; supply of coal and all the most
efficient apparatus for wrecking and sea-towing.&nbsp; She was a
staunch tug of 800 horse power, and was equipped with a powerful
electric search light.&nbsp; There were on board Captain James
and ten men, besides Albert Shaw, the captain&rsquo;s cousin, who
had no connection with the tug, but had obtained permission to
make one of the party more <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>through a love of adventure than
anything else.</p>
<p>After rounding the Delaware Capes and entering the open ocean,
the course was laid N.E. by N., and Captain James remarked to his
cousin as he finished examining the chart, &ldquo;Yes, Al, if all
goes well we ought to overhaul that brig within five days,
somewhere about 44 and 62.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You appear to regard falling in with her as a foregone
conclusion,&rdquo; replied Mr. Shaw, somewhat surprised.&nbsp; He
was a pale, slender young fellow of twenty-two, and was much more
expert at entering up cash and taking off trial balances than at
figuring latitude and longitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; answered the captain, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
marked on this chart the date and the place where she was
abandoned; then I&rsquo;ve put down a cross and the date at the
exact spot she&rsquo;s been sighted five different times since,
and by connecting all my crosses with a pencil mark and figuring
the distance between each one, I can tell about how much and in
what direction that wreck is drifting each day.&nbsp; She&rsquo;s
in the <a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Gulf Stream, which she won&rsquo;t get out of till I tow
her out.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the dinner bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s explanation had enlightened Albert as to
the method to be pursued in locating the wreck; though, to tell
the truth, he was a little skeptical in regard to the final
outcome of the matter. There was a brisk sea running, and in
spite of the table-rack, it required no little dexterity to
prevent beef, vegetables and condensed milk from mingling in one
confused jumble; but every one was in good humor, and the fresh,
salt air had sharpened the appetites of those who gathered about
the little table, and especially that of the captain&rsquo;s
cousin, who averred that he had not been so hungry in six months.
Dinner over, Albert busied himself in exploring every part of the
tug and investigating the night signals, when suddenly Captain
James called to him from the upper deck.&nbsp; Upon ascending
thither, he was informed that the <i>Atlas</i> was bearing down
on a floating lumber yard.&nbsp; Looking ahead he saw, still some
distance away, <a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>great quantities of planks floating about; in fact the
ocean seemed literally covered with them, forming a curious
sight.</p>
<p>The tug soon reached the outer edge of the moving mass, and
Jim Speers, the mate, remarked as he surveyed the white clean
planks with a critic&rsquo;s eye, &ldquo;Fine lumber, that.&nbsp;
Some good-sized vessel&rsquo;s lost her deck-load, I
reckon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The planks rose and fell on the long regular swell, and as
some of them were occasionally lifted partly out of water by a
sea, their shining wet surfaces reflected the sun&rsquo;s rays
with dazzling brilliancy.&nbsp; In some places they were massed
together so closely that it was difficult to find a passage
through them, and though the greater portion of this valuable lot
of timber was soon left behind, masses of planks were met
continually for a distance of nearly twenty miles.&nbsp; Captain
James took the bearings of the main body so as to report the
matter upon reaching port.</p>
<p>A six-knot breeze was blowing next morning but the sun did not
show himself, and noon having come with the sky still <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>cloudy, the
Captain was compelled to figure out his position by dead
reckoning, which is not so accurate as a solar observation.&nbsp;
He calculated that if everything went well, the tug should not be
far from the <i>Neptune</i> at the end of twenty-four hours,
providing his estimates of the brig&rsquo;s drift were
correct.</p>
<p>The afternoon wore on, and the skipper and his cousin had
paced the narrow deck for some moments in silence, when the
former remarked meditatively, &ldquo;I had a queer experience
with a derelict once,&mdash;just after I took this
tug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How was that?&rdquo; asked Albert.</p>
<p>The captain finished filling his pipe with fragments of
tobacco which he cut from a plug, and continued:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was about two years ago that I received orders to go
after the derelict bark <i>Pegasus</i>.&nbsp; She had sailed from
a Nova Scotia port for the West coast of Ireland with one million
feet of deals aboard, and after being abandoned in a big blow was
sighted several times.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m a sinner if we
didn&rsquo;t cruise twenty-five <a name="page93"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 93</span>hundred miles and use up half our
coal when, on the twelfth day out as I came on deck, my mate said
to me, &ldquo;Captain, there&rsquo;s a lame duck two points on
the port bow.&rdquo;&nbsp; (We seamen often speak of a crippled
vessel as a lame duck.)&nbsp; Well, we&rsquo;d run that bark down
at last, and we lost no time in getting her in tow.&nbsp; After
towing her two days, what do you think happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hawser parted?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She sank&mdash;went right down&mdash;and I went back to
port the most disgusted man in Philadelphia.&nbsp; We found,
after we got in, that a steamer passing the wreck and considering
her dangerous to navigation had set fire to her; but after
burning the main deck nearly through, and a hole in the stern,
the fire had been put out, probably by the seas which the bark
shipped.&nbsp; This was only a couple of days before we sighted
her.&nbsp; While we had her in tow I noticed that a good deal of
lumber washed out every time a big sea struck her, and I
didn&rsquo;t like it much either, though I made no doubt
she&rsquo;d float till we reached port.&nbsp; But, as I said, she
played me a mean trick <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>and foundered about four hundred
miles off the Delaware Capes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was tough luck,&rdquo; commented Albert, as he
glanced at the dial of the taffrail log which trailed
astern&mdash;its brass rotator revolving rapidly just beneath the
surface of the dark blue water.</p>
<p>Next day was bright and sunny, and an extra sharp lookout was
kept, for it was hoped to sight the derelict within the next
twelve hours.&nbsp; After ascertaining the tug&rsquo;s position
at noon, the course was changed to N.N.E., and things went on as
before.&nbsp; Mr. Shaw pored over the chart of the North
Atlantic, and was in a state of impatient expectancy all day,
although the mate kindly informed him that they might not sight
the brig for a week yet, if indeed they ever did.</p>
<p>It lacked but a few minutes of sunset, when the captain, who
for some time had been standing near the pilot-house sweeping the
horizon with his glass, cried sharply, &ldquo;Starboard your
helm, there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up now?&rdquo; asked Albert, ascending the
ladder to the upper deck.</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>&ldquo;A wreck of some kind, dead ahead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Taking the glass, he saw nothing at first, but finally made
out an object that looked like a pole sticking out of the
water.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That stick is the mast of a vessel,&rdquo; replied the
captain, in answer to Shaw&rsquo;s inquiry, &ldquo;and at least
half of it is carried away.&nbsp; The hull must be awash too, or
we could see it plainly now, for she can&rsquo;t be over six
miles off.&nbsp; If the craft was in her natural condition,
I&rsquo;d have sighted her long ago&mdash;at twelve miles
certainly.&nbsp; A little more and we&rsquo;d have run right away
from her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does she look like a brig, sir?&rdquo; asked
Speers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t make out her rig yet.&nbsp; The chap
we&rsquo;re after is hereabouts somewhere if I&rsquo;ve
calculated right,&rdquo; said the captain, taking another survey
of the object ahead.</p>
<p>The tug was rapidly closing up the gap between herself and the
wreck, and the faces of those on board presented an interesting
study.&nbsp; Captain James was anxious to know whether the wreck
they were <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>approaching was the brig he was in search of.&nbsp; The
usual excitement caused by the sight of an abandoned vessel did
not affect him; it was simply a matter of business. So also with
Speers, though perhaps to a less extent.&nbsp; The majority of
the crew contemplated the stranger with feelings akin to
indifference.&nbsp; Many of them did not know the name of the
vessel they were in search of,&mdash;neither did they care.&nbsp;
But Albert was looking at a genuine wreck for the first time, and
his heart beat faster as the ocean waif grew more and more
distinct, with her shattered masts, disordered rigging and
general appearance of desolation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Neptune</i>!&rdquo; cried Captain James, as he made
out the gilded letters on the port bow.&nbsp; He had already
formed the opinion that she was the craft of which he was in
search, as enough of her spars were left to show that she had
been square-rigged on her foremast, and brigs are now
comparatively scarce.</p>
<p>When the tug was within a few rods of the <i>Neptune</i>, her
boat was launched, and <a name="page97"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 97</span>the mate, Albert, and two of the crew
entered, when it was rowed around to the brig&rsquo;s bows in
search of a favorable place for boarding.&nbsp; A large rope,
probably the starboard fore-brace, was entangled in the standing
rigging in such a manner that fifteen or twenty feet of it
trailed in the water alongside the wreck.&nbsp; The mate picked
up the rope&rsquo;s end, and drew the boat so close to the brig
that, taking advantage of the next roll she gave towards him, he
seized a lanyard and was soon on board.&nbsp; Albert and Joe
Miller followed.&nbsp; The other man, known as
&ldquo;Sharkey,&rdquo; remained in the boat to see that she did
not get stove against the side of the wreck.</p>
<p>Speers took a cursory glance around, and then hailed the
tug.&nbsp; &ldquo;All ready, sir,&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; A rope
had been fastened to one end of the tug&rsquo;s big hawser, and
the other end of this rope Captain James now hove, so that it
landed on the brig&rsquo;s forecastle deck.&nbsp; The mate and
Joe Miller hauled it in, and secured the hawser to the
brig&rsquo;s bows.&nbsp; This important task having been
accomplished, the boarding party <a name="page98"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 98</span>proceeded to take a thorough survey
of the wreck.</p>
<p>The foremast was gone at the lower mast-head, leaving the fore
yard still in its place, upon which the tattered remnants of the
foresail were still visible.&nbsp; It had apparently been clewed
up without having been furled, and the winds of five weeks had
whipped it into ribbons.&nbsp; The entire mainmast was gone about
ten feet above the deck, and in falling had smashed the bulwarks
on the port beam and quarter so that the water flowed all over
the deck, where it was several inches deep.&nbsp; She was so low
that her main deck was level with the ocean, and small seas were
constantly toppling over her bows and low bulwarks, where they
broke in showers of spray.&nbsp; The main boom was hanging over
the side, while the bowsprit and all the jibs were entirely
gone.&nbsp; The main hatch was battened down, but the fore was
off, and upon looking below the cargo of lumber was seen pressed
up close under the hatch, where it occasionally surged slowly
from side to side in obedience to the <a name="page99"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 99</span>sluggish motions of the brig.&nbsp;
On top of the after house a small boat painted white was lashed,
having in some way escaped the general destruction.&nbsp; The
wheel and rudder appeared uninjured.&nbsp; There was a perfect
litter of ropes, blocks, standing rigging, etc., floating about
the deck, all tangled in a confused mass.</p>
<p>The party now entered the cabin.&nbsp; Everything here was
drenched; the skylights were gone; fragments of glass encumbered
all that portion of the floor not under water; and there was a
damp, musty smell such as one encounters on entering a cellar not
often opened.&nbsp; The captain&rsquo;s compass was still in its
place under the centre skylight, but its brass work was badly
stained with salt water.&nbsp; The state rooms were in much the
same condition as the cabin, and the whole port side of the after
house seemed to be slightly stove.&nbsp; The companion-way door
was ripped off, and nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>On emerging from this dismal place the mate took a peep into
the crew&rsquo;s quarters.&nbsp; The rows of bunks in which the
men had <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>slept still contained a mouldy mattress or two, while a
large cask that had doubtless been used as a table was rolling
about the floor.&nbsp; A couple of rusty pannikins floated about
in the shallow water.&nbsp; It was of course impossible to enter
the lazarette or the fore peak, for they were submerged.&nbsp;
All the provisions were ruined, but the scuttle butts contained
plenty of fresh water.</p>
<p>Having finished his examination, Speers sent the boat back to
the tug for a supply of provisions for Miller and Sharkey, who
were to remain on the wreck to steer her.&nbsp; As soon as the
stores were placed aboard, and a few directions given, Albert and
the mate pulled away from the derelict, for a squall was making
up in the north-west and it was high time to get under way.&nbsp;
Mast-head lanterns were run up, and the two vessels started for
Boston.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There was plenty to talk about that night, and Albert staid up
long past the usual time conversing with the master of the tug,
who was in a jubilant mood, and <a name="page101"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 101</span>who more than once invited his
cousin to &ldquo;splice the main brace.&rdquo; <a
name="citation101"></a><a href="#footnote101"
class="citation">[101]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;The owners will have to give me credit for quick work
this time,&rdquo; the captain said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Monday we left
Philadelphia; Wednesday we picked up the derelict; and on
Friday&mdash;or Saturday at furthest&mdash;we ought to steam up
Boston Harbor.&nbsp; Speers says the brig&rsquo;s cargo seems in
good shape, and if so it should easily bring $7,000 at
auction.&nbsp; The hull may fetch a thousand more.&nbsp; Not a
bad haul, Mr. Shaw for five days&rsquo; work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This derelict business seems profitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is&mdash;if you can find the derelict. For instance,
the schooner <i>Sargent</i> has been floating about the North
Atlantic ever since last spring, with twenty thousand
dollars&rsquo; worth of mahogany in her hold.&nbsp; There is a
prize worth trying for, but although a score of vessels have
sighted her, several of which attempted to <a
name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 102</span>tow her in,
she is still drifting about with a small fortune on board.&nbsp;
Last month some Baltimore parties organized an expedition and
chartered a steamer to find the <i>Sargent</i> and bring her
in.&nbsp; They searched for several weeks, and then returned to
port considerably out of pocket, to find that a Cunarder had just
seen the schooner not forty miles off the course they had
taken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go on deck; the night looks
squally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Albert turned in, and dreamed of drifting about the ocean for
many weeks on a water-logged wreck, which foundered the instant
assistance was at hand and he escaped only by leaping out of his
berth against the wall.</p>
<p>The heavily laden brig, submerged to her decks, offered a
great resistence to the water, and when a brisk head wind sprang
up, the powerful tug was scarcely able to make headway.&nbsp;
Several rain-squalls were encountered during the night, and by
sunrise there was every indication of a gale.</p>
<p>A heavy swell was running, the wind <a
name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 103</span>increased,
and Captain James felt some concern for the safety of his
tow.&nbsp; By noon a hard northwester had set in, accompanied by
an ugly head sea.&nbsp; Both vessels were under water most of the
time, nothing of the derelict being visible but her masts and
deck-houses, while the tug struggled through the heavy rollers
and blinding spray with only her smoke-stack and pilot house
above water.</p>
<p>It was a day of anxiety.&nbsp; The wreck was simply a sodden
mass of timber, without buoyancy, and dragged and pulled on the
huge hawser in a manner that caused continual apprehension.&nbsp;
Instead of rising to meet the big rollers, she went lurching and
floundering through them; burying herself in the brine, and then
coming up with a backward jerk that made the captain catch his
breath.&nbsp; Even a steel hawser has its limits of
endurance.</p>
<p>Night closed in chill and comfortless, with no sign of
immediate improvement.&nbsp; Albert put on a life-preserver,
braced himself in his bunk without undressing, and wondered if he
should ever see terra firma <a name="page104"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 104</span>again, while the cook shook his head
and confided to a deck-hand that &ldquo;this was what come of
having landsmen aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wind blew harder, and even a full steam pressure hardly
sufficed to drive the <i>Atlas</i> along.&nbsp; The middle watch
was half over when the straining tug plunged suddenly forward,
rolling and pitching violently, as though freed from a cumbersome
weight.&nbsp; At the same instant a muffled cry was heard by
those on the upper deck.&nbsp; All knew its meaning&mdash;the
derelict was adrift!</p>
<p>The night was black as pitch; mist and spray obscured
everything; and almost before the order to reverse the engines
could be given, the wreck was vanishing in the gloom.&nbsp; The
tug&rsquo;s head swung round and she started in pursuit.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes sufficed to show Captain James the utter
futility and peril of attempting to recover the brig until the
gale moderated.&nbsp; The <i>Atlas</i> was being literally
overwhelmed and forced under water by the furious seas which
overtook her.&nbsp; She could not steam fast enough to <a
name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 105</span>escape
them.&nbsp; One great comber bent the smoke-stack, smashed the
pilot-house windows, tore away the life-boat, and bore the tug
down until it seemed as though she would never come to the
surface.&nbsp; It was madness to continue, and the <i>Atlas</i>
was put about and hove to.</p>
<p>Never in his life had her captain suffered such keen
exasperation as now. With water streaming from his oilers, he
stood grasping the pilot-house rail, and watched the
derelict&rsquo;s mast head light glimmering astern like a
will-o&rsquo;-the-wisp; now hidden by a great wave,&mdash;now
reappearing fitfully,&mdash;now swallowed up in the black
night.&nbsp; He strained his eyes through the salt mist till they
ached, but the dismantled wreck and her imperilled crew were seen
no more.</p>
<p>The captain went below, and calculated as accurately as
possible the tug&rsquo;s position when the derelict broke adrift,
the direction and velocity of the wind, and force of the
current.&nbsp; Nothing could be done until the gale
moderated.&nbsp; There was ample time for everyone to discuss the
<a name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
106</span>misfortune, and speculation was rife as to the fate of
Joe Miller and Sharkey, who had last been seen at dusk, lashing
themselves to the shrouds.&nbsp; This would save them from going
overboard while the rigging held, but their slender stock of
provisions must have been swept away or ruined by water, which
would render their position desperate unless quickly rescued.</p>
<p>The gray dawn came, by which time the worst was over, and
eager eyes scanned the sea for some trace of the brig.&nbsp; But
the wreck, sitting very low in the water and with only a few feet
of her masts left, had drifted out of the line of vision, though
she was probably not fifteen miles away.&nbsp; Wind and sea were
still boisterous, but the search began immediately.</p>
<p>The conditions in general seemed to favor a speedy recovery of
the <i>Neptune</i>, for the wind was still in the same quarter,
the day was clearing rapidly, and the wreck having no sails and
being practically under water, could drift but slowly.&nbsp; But
the brig&rsquo;s condition, coupled with the fact that the tug
herself sat very low, <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>formed no slight obstacle to early
success.&nbsp; Had the <i>Atlas</i> possessed a tall mast, the
derelict might have been visible from it, but nothing could be
seen from the roof of the pilot-house save the smoke of a steamer
on the northern horizon.&nbsp; As time passed, bringing no
tidings of the missing vessel, the excitement increased, and a
handsome reward was promised any man who should first sight the
wreck.&nbsp; Twice a false alarm was given, but the day waned
until the shadows stole over the deep. Still there were no
tidings.</p>
<p>Through the starlit night Captain James thought of his absent
men and of the sufferings they must be enduring.&nbsp; He sent up
rockets at intervals, though with little hope of an answer; for
the <i>Neptune&rsquo;s</i> signalling apparatus was doubtless
ruined by water, and his men would be powerless to make their
presence known.</p>
<p>The sea was calm at daybreak, the sun shone brightly as the
hours flew by, and the tug covered many leagues, while the
promised reward kept all hands on the alert.&nbsp; The
<i>Atlas</i> overhauled a large bark, <a name="page108"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 108</span>and spoke her, but she had seen
nothing of the <i>Neptune</i>; and another day drew to a
close.</p>
<p>One of three things had happened: the derelict had foundered,
had been taken in tow by a passing steamer, or was still drifting
helplessly about.&nbsp; The first supposition was improbable, if
not impossible.&nbsp; Experience has shown that a vessel in the
<i>Neptune&rsquo;s</i> condition can survive tempests that send
stout ships to the bottom.&nbsp; As to the second, the number of
steamers having facilities for towing wrecks is small, and the
castaway&rsquo;s value must be great to induce one to attempt
salving her.&nbsp; The last supposition was probably the true
one.&nbsp; A vessel may float about the steam-traversed North
Atlantic for weeks without being seen, and not five derelicts in
a hundred are ever brought into port.&nbsp; After weighing the
chances carefully, the captain came to the conclusion that the
brig was still an aimless wanderer, though it was
incomprehensible how she could have eluded so thorough a
search.</p>
<p>The next day was but a repetition of <a
name="page109"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 109</span>the one
preceding, and this continued until the days became a week.&nbsp;
Hope was almost gone, the coal was two-thirds consumed, and still
Captain James would not give up.</p>
<p>Finally, ten days after the loss of the <i>Neptune</i>, the
<i>Atlas</i> abandoned the search and returned to
Philadelphia.</p>
<p>As soon as she was sighted by the operator in the marine
signal station, the fact was telephoned to the city; and when she
reached the dock, one of the owners was on hand to meet
her.&nbsp; Joe Miller and Sharkey were there also, sitting on a
box of merchandise, and exhibiting no traces of suffering or
emaciation.</p>
<p>The surprise of the tug&rsquo;s people was great, but the
captain was soon enlightened as to the derelict&rsquo;s
fate.&nbsp; That troublesome craft had been picked up the morning
after she broke adrift, by a West India fruit steamer bound to
Boston.&nbsp; Three-fourths of the steel hawser was still
attached to the <i>Neptune</i>, so the steamer had only to fish
up the broken end, secure it to her stern bits, and continue on
her <a name="page110"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
110</span>way.&nbsp; The weather remained fine and she reached
her destination the second day afterward.</p>
<p>The division of the salvage money was a delicate matter.&nbsp;
An abandoned vessel becomes the property of whoever brings her
into port, but in the present instance the derelict was held to
be the tug&rsquo;s property even after she broke adrift, because
she continued in possession of two of the tug&rsquo;s crew, who
remained on her from the time the hawser parted until she was
safely beached on the mud-flats in Boston harbor.&nbsp;
Consequently, she was not legally &ldquo;an abandoned
vessel&rdquo; when the fruiter picked her up; nor could the
latter have handled her at all except for the tug&rsquo;s
hawser.&nbsp; But the steamer had rendered an unquestioned
service by towing the wreck into port, and was therefore entitled
to a portion of the money.&nbsp; She was finally awarded 25%,
while the remainder went to the <i>Atlas</i>.</p>
<p>The lumber cargo realized a trifle over $6,000 at auction, but
the brig&rsquo;s hull had been badly strained and battered in the
<a name="page111"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 111</span>last
gale, and brought only $500.&nbsp; Her age, combined with her
severe injuries, made it unprofitable to put her in sea-going
condition, and she was converted into a lighter for transferring
merchandise about Boston harbor, in which humble capacity she
will probably end her days.</p>

</a>The homeward passage from New Zealand is made via Cape Horn,
and as westerly winds prevail all over the South Pacific, the
craft bound back to the States has everything in her favor.&nbsp;
Five weeks had elapsed since the thousand-ton bark <i>Western
Belle</i> sailed from Auckland and Wellington for Boston, and on
this June morning she was in the South Atlantic, steering a
north-easterly course.</p>
<p>It was evidently mid-day, for the captain and mate were
squinting at the sun through their sextants; while a young lady
<a name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>stood
near, wondering, as she had often done before, how it was
possible for such queer-looking instruments to aid in determining
their exact position upon so vast an expanse of water.</p>
<p>She was slightly above the medium height, and decidedly
pretty, with a fine color in her cheeks.&nbsp; The sun&rsquo;s
rays and ocean&rsquo;s breezes had tanned her fair skin until, as
she expressed it, &ldquo;her dearest friends couldn&rsquo;t have
told her from a South Sea Islander.&rdquo;&nbsp; A heavy blue
flannel dress, sailor blouse, jaunty cap kept in place by a long
pin, and rubber-soled tennis shoes&mdash;the finest things in the
world to keep one&rsquo;s footing in a heavy, sea&mdash;completed
the picture; and there you have Miss Laura Blake.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What would become of us, Captain, if you and Mr.
Bohlman were to fall overboard, or otherwise disappear from the
scene?&nbsp; It never occurred to me before, but there would be
no one left to bring us into port.&nbsp; Mr. Freeman knows
nothing about taking sights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Blake said this half in jest, half in <a
name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>earnest.&nbsp; The captain regarded it as a good
joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, the second mate has never used a sextant, I
believe, though he could doubtless navigate the bark for some
time by dead reckoning.&nbsp; Meanwhile, my dear young lady, you
and Mrs. Evans could study my Epitome, and learn to take the sun
yourselves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The idea of her aunt &ldquo;taking the sun&rdquo; caused a
quick smile to overspread Miss Laura&rsquo;s features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the <i>Western Belle</i> would soon
run ashore, or go to the bottom, if we women undertook to sail
her,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;As the widow of a
sea-captain, Aunt Sarah believes she knows all about ships, but I
fear it would require even more than her nautical knowledge to
bring us into port.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Maxwell shared this opinion, but he was far too
gallant a man to say so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Evans certainly learned a great deal during the
few voyages she made with her husband, and with your assistance,
Miss Blake, there is no telling what <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>you might not be able to accomplish.
However, both Mr. Bohlman and I are not liable to fall overboard,
so you will probably have no chance to distinguish yourselves as
navigators.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Though considerably past sixty, and with a head of snowy white
hair, no one ever thought of Captain Maxwell as elderly.&nbsp;
His dark eyes still shown with the fire of thirty, and every
motion of the erect, military figure was surprisingly quick and
agile.&nbsp; In ordinary conversation, his words were spoken with
an effective deliberation that is none too common now-a-days,
while a fine courtly air&mdash;&ldquo;old fashioned&rdquo; some
people called it&mdash;lent additional dignity to his
presence.</p>
<p>Mrs. Evans appeared at this moment emerging from the
companionway, and Captain Maxwell hastened to place a chair for
the widow of his old friend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it a beautiful day, Captain?&rdquo; the
lady exclaimed.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot recall a more delightful
morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree with you, madam; it certainly <a
name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 117</span>is a fine
day, although, as your niece says, a trifle cool
perhaps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Possibly.&nbsp; But we are approaching the Line, Laura,
and it will become warmer as the bark sails north.&nbsp; For my
part, I think this bracing air delightful, and have not regretted
returning to Boston in this manner rather than by steamer to San
Francisco.&nbsp; It reminds me of the two voyages I made with the
late Captain Evans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow&rsquo;s good-natured face beamed with amiability and
placid content.&nbsp; She was a comely matron, and though not
endowed with a great amount of intellect, its absence was in a
measure supplied by the charms of a thoroughly feminine and
womanly nature.</p>
<p>The ladies had been visiting relatives in Sydney, and had
expected to return to America by the Oceanic Liner
<i>Monowai</i>.&nbsp; Happening to meet Captain Maxwell on the
street one day, he had jokingly proposed that they take passage
with him to Boston.&nbsp; Mrs. Evans had known him well in past
years, and she instantly regarded the plan with favor.&nbsp; Her
niece, however, <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>knew no more of sailing vessels than does the average
landsman, who judges all craft of this description by the
coasting schooners which he has casually noticed, and had a vague
idea that it was flying in the face of Providence to go anywhere
in one.&nbsp; Yielding to the joint entreaties of her aunt and
Captain Maxwell, and considerably reassured by a view of the
<i>Western Belle</i>, she at length consented, and had so far
enjoyed the novelty of the trip exceedingly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neither do I regret it, Aunt,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;although it would be agreeable to know about what time we
may expect to reach Boston.&nbsp; That is the one drawback to
going anywhere on a sailing vessel&mdash;you can&rsquo;t tell how
long the voyage may last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time required to go from New Zealand back to the
States does not vary much,&rdquo; the captain answered,
&ldquo;and I think I can promise you, Miss Blake, that the trip
will not greatly exceed ninety days.&nbsp; We have made a good
run nearly every day so far, and ought to pick up the southeast
trades next week.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>&ldquo;Even if the voyage should require four months,
it would be nothing dreadful, Laura.&nbsp; We seamen do not mind
a few days more or less, do we, Captain?&rdquo; said the
widow.</p>
<p>Carl Bohlman, the portly mate, seemed a little surprised at
this reckless disregard of time, while Captain Maxwell stroked
his beard and looked rather doubtful.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not, madam.&nbsp; Your wide experience enables
you to judge of such matters.&nbsp; I remember one time, though,
when your late husband had the <i>Davy Crockett</i>, and I
commanded the <i>Sunrise</i>, we were racing from Hong Kong to
New York; and I can assure you that every minute and every hour
were of the utmost importance.&nbsp; We both passed St. Helena on
the fifty-eighth day out, but the <i>Sunrise</i> was beaten on
the home stretch by twenty-four hours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How exciting!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evans.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Think of it&mdash;racing clear around the world!&nbsp;
That was before I met my husband, but I have often heard him
mention the affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>&ldquo;It must be dangerous, Aunt.&nbsp; We have the
pretty Cape pigeons to race with, which satisfies me
perfectly.&nbsp; How sorry I shall be when we see the last of
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are timid, Laura, which is excusable in one of your
limited experience.&nbsp; You have crossed the Atlantic twice,
but running over from New York to Liverpool is a mere
bagatelle.&nbsp; Crossing the Pacific is something, to be sure;
but when you have doubled both Capes, and crossed the Line six
times&mdash;well, then you can lay claim to being a sailor, and
will not be easily alarmed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The widow glanced from one to the other and settled back in
her chair with pardonable pride, after giving this account of her
achievements.&nbsp; She was rewarded with a bow from Captain
Maxwell, who then said:</p>
<p>&ldquo;To change the subject, Mrs. Evans, you must have been
very busy this morning.&nbsp; Unless I am mistaken, we have been
deprived of your society since breakfast.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true, Captain.&nbsp; I have been putting the
finishing touches on that rug, <a name="page121"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 121</span>which I consider quite an addition
to the cabin furniture.&nbsp; After that, I wrote for some
time&mdash;and ah! that reminds me.&nbsp; I feel certain that the
fresh-water tank in the bathroom has again been filled with salt
water.&nbsp; While endeavoring to remove an ink-stain from my
fingers, I found that the soap made no impression.&nbsp; That
careless boy seems unable to remember which tank is for fresh
water, and which for salt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain frowned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the second time since leaving port that Dick
has made the same mistake. When I have worked out my sights, the
matter shall be attended to.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That Dick Lewis needs a rope&rsquo;s end,&rdquo;
observed the mate, as soon as Captain Maxwell had gone below,
&ldquo;and if the captain would let me, I&rsquo;d give it to
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something peculiar about that boy,&rdquo; said
Miss Blake.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sometimes I think his mind is not quite
right.&nbsp; You know what a mania he seems to have for
fire-works, Aunt.&nbsp; We were not a week out before he was
found to have matches and fire-crackers concealed in the <a
name="page122"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
122</span>forecastle.&nbsp; Then one afternoon not long ago he
was discovered in the lazarette, although no one had sent him
there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, miss; and the captain thought Dick
might have been fooling with the signal-lights and rockets.&nbsp;
I hardly think that, though.&nbsp; Most likely he was after the
eatables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can see, Laura, what sort of sailors the future
generation of captains will have to contend with.&nbsp; Do you
suppose such things ever happened on my husband&rsquo;s
ship?&nbsp; Fresh and salt water mixed together, matches and
fire-works in the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sl, rockets and signals in the
lazarette?&nbsp; Why, it is awful to think of!&rdquo;&nbsp; And
the widow shook her head, as she reflected on this extraordinary
state of affairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That boy in the second mate&rsquo;s watch is worth a
dozen of this one of mine,&rdquo; Bohlman observed.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Freeman predicted he would be the day we divided up the
watches, and he was about right.&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t tell him I
think so, though.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The second mate had just come on deck, and Miss Blake said
mischievously: &ldquo;I <a name="page123"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 123</span>shall tell Mr. Freeman what you said
unless you promise to rig up a bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un&rsquo;s chair
this afternoon, and hoist me up one of the masts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do it, miss, if you say so,&rdquo; replied
Bohlman, &ldquo;though you got scared the other time before you
were a quarter of the way up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laura, I will not allow such a thing again.&nbsp; What
would you think if I were to go aloft and haul over a
buntline?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should laugh, Aunt; I know I should,&rdquo; and Miss
Laura did laugh aloud, while the mate turned away to avoid
showing his merriment at the comical idea of the widow
overhauling buntlines.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But really, Aunt, there is no danger in it, and Mrs.
Brassey, in &lsquo;Around the World in the Yacht
<i>Sunbeam</i>,&rsquo; speaks of being drawn clear up to the
mast-head in a bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un&rsquo;s chair.&nbsp; It is
said, also, that Bernhardt climbed the rigging of a steamer one
day when on her way to Australia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Genius is always eccentric, my dear, and may do
anything with impunity.&nbsp; But there&mdash;dinner is
served.&nbsp; Let us go.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page124"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 124</span>One
could not pass through the bark&rsquo;s comfortable cabin without
knowing that women were on board.&nbsp; The very arrangement of
the chairs showed it.&nbsp; No matter how neat and tasteful a man
may be&mdash;and Captain Maxwell was both&mdash;he can seldom
give to a room or dwelling that indescribable air of home-like
comfort and domesticity that a clever woman finds it so easy to
impart.&nbsp; There was something cheerful in the appearance of
the widow&rsquo;s open work-box, with its pretty blue lining, and
an anchor worked on the inside cover,&mdash;for Mrs. Evans
affected everything nautical,&mdash;while a large rug or mat made
of spun-yarn and sennit bore witness to her skill.&nbsp; The
vessel&rsquo;s name was neatly worked in the center.&nbsp;
Several water-color paintings by Miss Laura ornamented the walls,
and a globe of goldfish swung from the ceiling.&nbsp; An upright
piano occupied the space between two doors.&nbsp; There was
nothing especially elegant or luxurious, as the bark had never
been intended for a passenger vessel, but everything was very
pleasant and comfortable.&nbsp; The ladies had <a
name="page125"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 125</span>separate
state-rooms, each of which contained but one berth, and was
considerably larger than the average state-room on a passenger
steamer.</p>
<p>After dinner, Captain Maxwell sent for Dick Lewis to come to
the quarter-deck.&nbsp; This boy belonged to the mate&rsquo;s
watch, which was now off duty.&nbsp; He had not turned in,
however, but could be seen with two others of the crew, washing
his clothes in the lee scuppers.</p>
<p>It had rained hard the night before, and many of the hands
availed themselves of the chance to catch the water for laundry
purposes.&nbsp; Two lines were stretched from a starboard
backstay to one on the port side, on which were hung shirts of
various colors and patterns, patched overalls, towels, socks that
had never been mates, and various other articles of apparel.</p>
<p>Dick came aft presently, and stood before the captain; a
lanky, unprepossessing youth of sixteen or seventeen.&nbsp; A
carroty head of hair, low forehead, white eyebrows and lashes,
very pale complexion, and keen blue eyes which constantly <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 126</span>shifted
about&mdash;these were the most noticeable points of his
appearance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick,&rdquo; said Captain Maxwell, &ldquo;for the
second time within two weeks, you have put salt water in the
fresh water tank. This must not happen again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must have put the funnel in the wrong hole,
sir,&rdquo; said Dick, not appearing much abashed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is evident.&nbsp; Get a marline-spike from the
second mate and then go out on the end of the jib-boom.&nbsp;
Stay there and pound the rust off the chains until three bells
strike.&nbsp; That may help you to remember.&nbsp; Go
forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain told Mr. Freeman what Dick was to do, and then
went below for his nap. Out on the jib-boom, Dick performed his
allotted task.&nbsp; What was passing in the boy&rsquo;s mind, it
would be hard to tell from the expression of his face.&nbsp;
Resentment against Captain Maxwell?&nbsp; Scarcely. He seemed
rather to be studying over some project.&nbsp; Now his lips
moved, as though talking to himself.&nbsp; Then would <a
name="page127"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 127</span>follow a
low chuckle, as of satisfaction at solving some intricate
problem.&nbsp; At such moments, his knitted brows became smooth,
and the chains were pounded with a vigor that seemed to give a
kind of pleasure to the worker.&nbsp; Once or twice his revery
was disturbed by a fancied footstep, and he furtively glanced
around to see if anyone was watching.</p>
<p>Three bells had struck some little time before a hail from the
deck attracted Dick&rsquo;s attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jib-boom, there!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, aye, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up, Dick.&nbsp; You must like to pound
chains.&rdquo; It was the second mate who spoke.</p>
<p>Dick felt for the foot-ropes, and remembering Mr.
Freeman&rsquo;s injunction not to let the marline-spike go
overboard, he slung it round his neck, and made his way to the
deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are your ears, Dick?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my head, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page128"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
128</span>&ldquo;No impudence, you lubber!&nbsp; Next time
I&rsquo;ll let you work till we make port. Hand over that
marline-spike.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; Will you please tell me something, Mr.
Freeman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Maybe so, if I can.&nbsp; The mate says I don&rsquo;t
know anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to know, sir, how you send off those
signal-lights, what I was forbid to touch.&nbsp; Are they like
Roman candles?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman took hold of the youth&rsquo;s arm, and said sternly,
&ldquo;Dick Lewis, don&rsquo;t you ever think of those
things.&nbsp; Why, d&mdash; it, you&rsquo;re as crazy as a loon
about fire-works! If you&rsquo;ve got any more stowed away in the
fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sl, it&rsquo;ll go hard with you.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ve got nothing against you, Dick, but if I hear any more
talk like this, it&rsquo;s my duty to report to the
captain.&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll soon be in irons, at this
rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was only fooling, sir.&nbsp; Please don&rsquo;t give
me away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Vast talking, and go below.&nbsp; The watch is
half over now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick disappeared into the forecastle, and Freeman meditated
for some time <a name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
129</span>over the possible meaning of the boy&rsquo;s peculiar
talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll bear watching,&rdquo; he mused.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d better tell Bohlman not to send him into the
lazarette, on any account.&nbsp; No, I won&rsquo;t, either; the
Dutchman&rsquo;s too d&mdash;d arrogant, and thinks he knows it
all.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d only be told to mind my own
business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman had just reached this decision in regard to Dick, when
a Greek sailor called Asso approached, and asked for more
bath-brick.</p>
<p>The officer went to see how his watch were getting on with
their job of cleaning the paint-work on the deck-houses, and
found that buckets of water, swabs, and bath-bricks, were being
used to such purpose that the white paint was rapidly assuming
the appearance of new-fallen snow.&nbsp; Then there was a section
of wire cable to be spliced, and other work to be seen to.&nbsp;
Thus the afternoon passed, and Dick&rsquo;s talk about the
signals was banished from the second mate&rsquo;s mind by the
various duties of the hour.</p>
<h3><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> II.</h3>
<p>It was a fine evening.&nbsp; The full moon had risen out of
the ocean in matchless splendor, and was rapidly changing its
blood-red hues for more silvery tints, as it soared into the
cloudless sky.</p>
<p>The captain and passengers were on the quarter-deck, while Mr.
Freeman hung over the rail with the comfortable assurance that
the bark was making a better run in the second dog-watch than she
had in the first, when the mate had been in charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told you, Miss Blake, I should get a good breeze in
my watch, and you see I&rsquo;m as good as my word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I perceive; and now that you have it, see that it
doesn&rsquo;t fail us before morning.&nbsp; Otherwise I shall
think your fine breeze all the result of luck.&nbsp; How pleasant
it is to hear the water gurgling around the ship.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Eight bells struck, and the dog-watch was over.&nbsp; The
wheel and lookout were relieved, and Freeman went below, while <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 131</span>Carl
Bohlman came on duty to stand the first watch, which lasted until
midnight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, Aunt?&nbsp; For ten minutes
you have not spoken a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The beauty of the night has cast a spell over me,
Laura, and I was thinking of a favorite poem of mine.&nbsp; I
never realized the significance of the first stanza more than on
this evening, when we are out on the great ocean with every
object bathed in white light.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&lsquo;The dews of summer night did
fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The moon, sweet regent of the sky,<br />
Silvered the walls of Cumnor Hall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And many an oak that grew thereby.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent, my dear madam,&rdquo; said Captain
Maxwell.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have a fine poetic instinct.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The oaks that grew around Amy Robsart&rsquo;s luxurious
prison are replaced here by the bark&rsquo;s masts and sails,
captain, but the effect is not less beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A fine conception, Mrs. Evans, but we must remember
that it is not summer in these latitudes, even though the dew is
gathering, and you may take cold sitting there.&nbsp; Will you
take my arm?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
132</span>&ldquo;With pleasure, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They had paced the deck for some minutes, and the widow was
relating some story that seemed greatly to amuse the captain,
when the latter stopped suddenly, dropped on one knee, and stared
at one of the deadlights&rsquo; near his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&nbsp; How you startled me, captain.&nbsp;
Robinson Crusoe couldn&rsquo;t have been more astonished when he
saw the footprint in the sand, than you seem to be. What is
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Worse than a footprint, Mrs. Evans. The moonlight
prevented our noticing it sooner.&nbsp; Stand here&mdash;where
your shadow falls on this deadlight. <a name="citation132"></a><a
href="#footnote132" class="citation">[132]</a>&nbsp; Now what do
you see?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A light reflected from below.&nbsp; Oh, Laura, the
lazarette is on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Maxwell was already disappearing through the hatchway,
while the mate and Miss Blake ran up at the widow&rsquo;s
exclamation.&nbsp; Even the silent figure at the <a
name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 133</span>wheel
started at the mention of the word fire.</p>
<p>It was but a moment before the master of the bark reappeared,
bearing a lighted lantern in one hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cause for alarm is removed, ladies,&rdquo; he said
quietly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is no fire in the lazarette, though
nothing short of a miracle prevented it.&nbsp; This lantern was
standing on the floor beneath the deadlight and caused the
reflection to appear.&nbsp; Mr. Bohlman, have you any idea how it
came there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He spoke with apparent calmness, which Miss Blake readily saw
was more feigned than real.</p>
<p>The mate hesitated a moment before answering: &ldquo;Dick must
have left it there, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Dick must have left it there</i>!&nbsp; So that
bright boy of yours has been in the lazarette again without
permission?&nbsp; If I don&rsquo;t have him triced up to the
spanker-boom in irons early to-morrow morning, my name&rsquo;s
not John Maxwell.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
134</span>&ldquo;He was in the lazarette, sir, but not without
permission.&nbsp; I sent him there just before supper to bring up
a coil of old rope that was to be ravelled out.&nbsp; He
wasn&rsquo;t there ten minutes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Both ladies glanced at the mate in surprise at these words,
and Captain Maxwell looked at his chief officer in a way that was
anything but complimentary to the latter.&nbsp; The captain had a
temper of his own, which was under excellent control, but he
found it necessary to cross the quarter-deck twice before
trusting himself to speak.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After that occasion a week ago, when this boy was
discovered in the lazarette doing God knows what, I should have
thought your own judgment would have prevented your sending him
there again.&nbsp; There are plenty of men in your watch, and if
none of them knew where this old rope was, you should have gone
yourself, rather than let that fool of a boy take a light into
such a place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bohlman smarted under this speech, though he maintained a
discreet silence, <a name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
135</span>knowing it would be useless to attempt to justify
himself in the captain&rsquo;s present humor.&nbsp; Inwardly,
however, he cursed Dick Lewis for having forgotten the lantern,
and thus bringing his superior&rsquo;s censure upon himself.</p>
<p>Orders were given for Dick to come aft, and the youth shortly
appeared on the quarter-deck for the second time that day in the
role of culprit.&nbsp; He quailed before the captain&rsquo;s
glance, and nervously shifted his old felt hat from one hand to
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know why you have been sent for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick pointed to the accusing lantern, and said in a frightened
tone: &ldquo;Yes, sir.&nbsp; I&mdash;I remember now I forgot to
bring up the lantern when&mdash;when I fetched the
rope.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a lie.&nbsp; He had turned the wick low and then left
it in the lazarette purposely, knowing well that no one would
enter the place after the day&rsquo;s work was done.&nbsp; But
for the accidental circumstance of its having been placed too
near one of the deadlights, the presence of the lantern would
never have been suspected.</p>
<p><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>&ldquo;Do you know what I ought to do with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s tones were so stern that Dick was hardly
able to articulate &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to take a rope&rsquo;s end and beat you within
an inch of your life.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s what any captain would
have done twenty years ago, and what some would do now.&nbsp; You
left this light down there among bales of oakum, sennit, old
sails, rockets, signal-lights, and other inflammable stuff, and
if there had been enough sea running to heel the bark over a
trifle more, the lantern would have upset, setting the whole
place on fire&mdash;and we out in the South Atlantic, a good
week&rsquo;s sail from the nearest port!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s passion mastered him, and he shook Dick
until the boy&rsquo;s teeth chattered.&nbsp; Suddenly releasing
him, he turned to Mrs. Evans and her niece.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I ought to apologize, ladies, for this outburst; but I
lost one ship by fire years ago, and this boy has tried me beyond
endurance.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>&ldquo;I do not blame you in the least, captain,&rdquo;
said the alarmed widow; &ldquo;I feel sure my husband would have
inflicted a severe punishment for such an offense.&nbsp; It is as
bad as Guy Fawkes and the gunpowder plot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, madam, we officers have to put up with a good
deal from sailors now-a-days,&rdquo; said Captain Maxwell,
sarcastically.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I punished that boy as he
deserved, he would have me arrested the moment we reached
port.&nbsp; Then, aided by some unscrupulous lawyer and the
testimony of various members of the crew, I should be convicted
of &lsquo;cruel and unusual punishment,&rsquo; and fined heavily,
or imprisoned.&nbsp; The evidence of yourself and niece might
clear me in this case, but all the papers would print articles
about the barbarity of captains and mates in general, and the lot
of the poor, abused merchant-sailor,&mdash;forgetting to mention
the fact that a vessel, her cargo, and all hands, had narrowly
escaped a terrible disaster at the hands of one of these
persecuted saints!</p>
<p><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>&ldquo;Dick, you were warned a week ago that if you
entered the lazarette again without permission you would be put
in irons.&nbsp; But it seems you had permission,&rdquo; with a
glance at the mate,&mdash;&ldquo;and so we shall have to let you
off easier.&nbsp; Go up on the fore royal yard and sit there
until the watch ends at midnight.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dick was unable to repress a sigh of relief as he turned away,
but his sharp ears heard Captain Maxwell say to the mate:
&ldquo;As soon as it is light enough to-morrow morning to see
objects in the lazarette without a lantern, bring up that
canister of powder and those four boxes of rockets and
signal-lights.&nbsp; They shall be kept in a locker in the cabin
during the rest of the voyage.&nbsp; Another thing&mdash;never
again let that boy go anywhere with a light.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cause of this trouble went forward, muttering to himself:
&ldquo;Powder! the captain said powder!&nbsp; I might have found
it to-night if they hadn&rsquo;t caught onto the lantern.&nbsp;
How did they know it was there, I wonder?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>He
climbed the fore rigging, unmindful of the taunts of the crew at
his second punishment that day, and the captain&rsquo;s words
kept ringing in his ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow morning they&rsquo;ll all be put where I
can&rsquo;t get at &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and if
only they hadn&rsquo;t found the lantern, I could have got away
with some of them rockets to-night.&nbsp; And the powder!&nbsp; I
can&rsquo;t do nothing without a lantern, though, and I
ain&rsquo;t even got a match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He perched himself upon the royal yard, with a lunatic&rsquo;s
cunning, inventing various schemes for getting at those
fire-works.&nbsp; That was his mania.&nbsp; Although as sane as
anyone on other subjects, he was an absolute monomaniac in
everything relating to such matters; and since the day when he
had overheard a remark relating to the signal-lights and rockets,
his fingers had itched to investigate them and see what they were
like.&nbsp; Not even the certainty of punishment could stand in
his way.</p>
<p>Some people, when they ascend to the roof of a high building,
have an almost irresistable desire to leap from it.&nbsp; It is
<a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 140</span>not that
they wish to do so, but some strange power seems urging them to
it in spite of themselves.&nbsp; Others have a similar feeling
when in close proximity to a swiftly-moving railroad train, and
require all their will power to keep from casting themselves
before the locomotive.&nbsp; So it was with Dick Lewis.&nbsp; He
could no more keep his mind off the lazarette and its contents,
than steel can resist the influence of a magnet.&nbsp; He sat
there as the hours passed, looking ahead into vacancy; thinking
and thinking; and imagining just how the rockets must look, as
they lay side by side in their boxes down in the midnight
darkness of the lazarette.&nbsp; How quiet and silent they
were!&nbsp; And yet the touch of a match&mdash;</p>
<p>He put up a hand before his eyes and turned his head to one
side, as though to ward off a blow.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&ldquo;Aunt, we really must go below.&nbsp; It cannot be far
from twelve o&rsquo;clock, and we have staid on deck nearly two
hours past the usual time.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
141</span>&ldquo;That is true, Laura; and yet I feel strangely
wakeful.&nbsp; But, as you say, it is very late, and high time
that we turned in.&nbsp; So good night, captain, and pleasant
dreams.&nbsp; Good night, Mr. Bohlman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Evans paused as she reached the companion-way.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How beautiful the moonlight is,&rdquo; she said, so low
that no one heard; &ldquo;and from what an awful peril have we
this night been delivered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She slowly followed her niece to the cabin.</p>
<p>Captain Maxwell did not linger long on deck after his
passengers had turned in. He, too, usually retired early, and
arose at daylight.&nbsp; But the incident of the lighted lantern
disturbed him.&nbsp; To the master who has once experienced fire
at sea, the mere possibility of another visitation conveys a
dread that the worst hurricane cannot inspire.&nbsp; He paced the
deck for some time, and then, after a glance aloft, went
below.</p>
<p>Midnight came; and the mate was relieved by Frank Freeman, who
found his superior in no very pleasant frame of mind.</p>
<p><a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve still got a fair wind,&rdquo;
Freeman observed; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s slipping through it in good
shape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you expected to come on deck and find a dead
calm, with me and my watch ahead in the long-boat, towing the
bark.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bohlman left the quarter-deck with this good-natured
rejoinder, while the second mate smothered a laugh as he lit his
pipe.</p>
<p>Dick climbed down the fore rigging with alacrity, and entered
the forecastle with the rest of the port watch.&nbsp; His plans
were matured.&nbsp; There was a triumphant light in the
boy&rsquo;s eyes, and a furtive smile on his ill-favored features
as he crept into his bunk and feigned sleep.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>A lantern swung from the dingy ceiling, casting a flickering
light upon the tiers of bunks, and upon various other objects in
the forecastle.&nbsp; There were oilers and rubber boots thrown
about here and there, old books without covers, and sea-chests of
various patterns.&nbsp; The numerous initials, names, and dates,
cut into the walls <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
143</span>indicated that the <i>Western Belle</i> had sailed the
seas for many years.&nbsp; On one side some one with a talent for
drawing had recently executed a chalk picture of the whale
swallowing Jonah, which was a marvel of realism.&nbsp; Near this
artistic production was tacked a printed card setting forth what
rules the crew were expected to obey, what compensation they were
to receive, and other matters of like import.</p>
<p>Sea air and insomnia are deadly enemies, and before one bell
struck, a chorus of snores assured Dick that his companions were
asleep.&nbsp; He suffered a few minutes over the half hour to
elapse, and then slipped noiselessly from his bunk.&nbsp; Gliding
to the open door, he looked stealthily out.&nbsp; That side of
the deck was thrown into shadow by the forecastle, and no one was
to be seen but two of the watch on duty slowly walking up and
down the main deck, as they conversed in low tones.&nbsp; The
others were doubtless on the opposite side of the
forward-house.</p>
<p>Dick turned from the door, waited a moment to be sure that all
were asleep in <a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>the bunks around him, and then produced a towel.&nbsp;
Next he took down the lantern from its hook overhead, and wrapped
the towel about it so that the light was invisible.&nbsp; That
done, he made for the door,&mdash;stepped out on deck,&mdash;and
crept forward in the shadow of the building.</p>
<p>Upon reaching the corner, he stopped and listened The distant
murmur of voices was heard on the opposite side of the house, but
the moonlit stretch of deck ahead was untenanted.&nbsp;
Apparently no one was about the extreme forward part of the
vessel except the lookout.&nbsp; The boy&rsquo;s unshod feet made
no sound as he darted across the strip of moonlight that fell
between the forward-house and the forecastle deck.&nbsp; Now he
was standing by the open fore hatch.</p>
<p>In large sailing vessels that stand well out of water, it is
customary to leave the fore hatch off at all times unless some
very severe gale is threatened.&nbsp; The forecastle deck
overhead prevents rain or salt water from entering, and as it is
often necessary to go down to the fore peak half a dozen <a
name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 145</span>times a
day, it would be a useless trouble to move the hatch-cover each
time.&nbsp; This was the case with the <i>Western Belle</i>.</p>
<p>Dick well knew he could not enter the lazarette at the
customary place without being seen by the man at the wheel and
the officer on duty, and had conceived the laborious, but
perfectly feasible plan, of descending through the fore hatch to
the &rsquo;tween-decks, and then crawling aft over the cargo the
whole length of the vessel to accomplish his purpose.</p>
<p>Without losing time, he placed his foot upon the first step of
the flight of stairs that led down to the fore peak, and then
rapidly descended.&nbsp; It was black as Erebus when he reached
the bottom, and before taking another step he uncovered the
lantern and stuffed the towel in his pocket.&nbsp; Cautiously
walking over old sails, ropes, barrels, casks, etc., the boy was
soon out of the fore peak proper, and at that part of the
&rsquo;tween-decks where the cargo began to be stowed.</p>
<p>The foremast looming up ahead gave him quite a start, and a
sort of dread <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>possessed him at thought of the long distance to be
traversed in that profound darkness.&nbsp; Dick had not realized
until now the magnitude of the task before him, but he only
wavered a second, and pushed on.</p>
<p>It soon became impossible to walk, and he dropped on his hands
and knees, creeping along on all fours; at the same time holding
the handle of the lantern between his teeth.&nbsp; Its rays
illumined but a short space in front, though they served to make
the gaunt deck-beams assume all sorts of strange and fantastic
shapes that he could not help noticing.&nbsp; Thus he crawled
along over bales of flax and tow, boxes of Kauri gum and sacks of
horns; picking his way carefully, and impatiently wondering how
far he had progressed.&nbsp; This was at length made plain,
though in an unexpected manner.</p>
<p>In attempting to accelerate his speed, the boy had grown a
little careless, when he suddenly felt his left hand go off into
space, and barely saved himself from plunging headlong
downward.&nbsp; The shock was a severe one, and he drew a deep <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>breath of
relief when he had backed away from the yawning aperture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fool!&rdquo; he muttered; &ldquo;I clean forgot the
main hatch.&nbsp; I like to have fell all the way down to the
lower hold and broke my neck.&nbsp; Well, Dick, you&rsquo;re half
way, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He crawled around the square opening and proceeded.&nbsp; In a
few minutes the way was blocked by a great object that the youth
could not account for, but which was really the iron tank
containing drinking water.&nbsp; He avoided it and continued to
advance, having stopped a moment to stretch his cramped
limbs.&nbsp; Next he came to the after hatch, but was on the
lookout for it and pushed on steadily, though he began to ache
all over from crawling so long.&nbsp; Once a startled rat
scurried across his stockinged foot in its haste to escape,
causing another momentary scare.&nbsp; Had it not been for the
increasing excitement under which he labored, the boy must have
been chilled, for a draft of cold air like that in a cellar swept
through the <a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>&rsquo;tween-decks from one end of the bark to the
other.</p>
<p>The mizzen mast told Dick his journey was nearing its end, and
he stopped a few seconds to take breath.&nbsp; His heart beat so
quick and fast that he felt stifled, and his limbs trembled in a
way that he could not account for.&nbsp; But the thought of the
fire-works nerved him, and cans of powder danced before his
disordered imagination.</p>
<p>There was not much further to go, so after shoving back the
hair from his damp forehead, he crept on until the peculiar
formation of the vessel&rsquo;s timbers proved that he was in the
stern.</p>
<p>He looked up.&nbsp; Directly overhead was a small opening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That must be <i>it</i>!&rdquo; he whispered.</p>
<p>There were no stairs nor any ladder, but standing erect, his
head was just on a level with the aperture.&nbsp; First arranging
the towel about the top of the lantern so that the light should
not be cast upward, he reached up and set it down on the floor
above.&nbsp; Then, panting with excitement <a
name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 149</span>and bathed
in cold perspiration, Dick placed both hands on the edge of the
hatch.</p>
<p>One agile spring, and he was in the lazarette.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> III.</h3>
<p>So quiet was the night, that Freeman&rsquo;s measured
footsteps, as he trod the quarter-deck, sounded with strange
distinctness to the guilty occupant of the space beneath.&nbsp;
No other sound disturbed the silence but the gentle swish and
gurgle of the water alongside, and an occasional creak from some
block or pulley.</p>
<p>The piles of swelling canvas; the mast-heads nodding against
the stars; the white paint-work of the poop; the delicate shadows
cast upon the deck by the ropes and shrouds; the motionless
figure of the man at the wheel;&mdash;all were beautified and
softened by the white flood of moonlight. Drops of dew glittered
everywhere, and when Freeman laid his hand upon the main brace,
it was wet as though from rain.</p>
<p>He had been reading odd items in an <a
name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>old copy of
the Sydney <i>Herald</i>, and put it down just as two great rats
that had come up from the hold scampered across the deck.&nbsp;
This was nothing unusual, and after stamping with his foot to
scare the bold creatures, he glanced at the binnacle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her at N. N. E., Matt; you&rsquo;ve let her go off
a point.&nbsp; Watch the card, man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep her at N. N. E., sir,&rdquo; the fellow repeated,
shifting his quid to starboard as Freeman walked away.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll see how the lookout does,&rdquo; the officer
thought, &ldquo;though if every night was like this,
there&rsquo;d be little need of any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went forward along the port side.&nbsp; Happening to cast a
glance through the open forecastle door, he noticed that the
light was out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; he soliloquized; &ldquo;it
burned brightly enough when I passed by a couple of hours
ago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He entered the door to see if the wick was out of order, or
whether all the oil had been consumed.&nbsp; Neither&mdash;the
lantern was gone!</p>
<p><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 151</span>He
had just made this discovery, and was leaving the building to ask
his men whether any of them had removed the light, when a curious
jarring sensation rooted him to the deck.&nbsp; The idea of a
submarine earthquake flashed through his brain, but within a
second&rsquo;s time there was a deafening report,&mdash;a
blinding flash,&mdash;a staggering of the bark,&mdash;and then
flying timbers and bales of merchandise were hurled skyward with
awful power.&nbsp; The whole after part of the vessel seemed
going up in the air piecemeal!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; breathed Freeman, grasping the ladder
on the forward house.</p>
<p>His self-possession soon returned.&nbsp; Already some of the
crew had begun to act like lunatics.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call all hands, and behave like men.&nbsp; The
bark&rsquo;s still afloat, and now three of you come aft with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His cool decision inspired confidence, and half a dozen of the
crew followed.</p>
<p>The canvas began to flap&mdash;the bark was badly off her
course.&nbsp; Freeman bounded on as he noticed this fact.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;That cowardly Matt&rsquo;s deserted the
wheel,&rdquo; he thought&mdash;&ldquo;or else the poor
devil&rsquo;s been killed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the officer stood motionless when he reached the place
where the quarter-deck had been&mdash;the spot where he had been
standing not five minutes since.&nbsp; The whole deck was gone,
and in its place was a great cavity that reached from one side of
the vessel to the other, and seemed to go down to the very
keelson.</p>
<p>It was a time for action, and he crept along on the starboard
side, walking on a few jagged splinters, and holding to the main
brace with his hands.&nbsp; The wheel had been shattered and was
useless, while Matt lay against the rail where the force of the
explosion had hurled him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Men, sheet everything home, and move d&mdash;d
quick!&nbsp; The wheel&rsquo;s smashed and we can&rsquo;t steer
the bark.&nbsp; Let go all the halyards and sheets, and get her
stripped.&nbsp; Work for your lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Had the wind been stronger, a serious accident would probably
have resulted before the unmanageable vessel could have <a
name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 153</span>been
relieved of her canvas, but although she careened badly, it was
but a few minutes before enough sails had been taken in to avert
the threatened danger.</p>
<p>The unaccountable disaster that had befallen was sufficiently
appalling to those who were on deck at the time it occurred; but
imagine the feelings of the others&mdash;roused from a sound
sleep at three in the morning by a shock as of an
earthquake.&nbsp; The mate&rsquo;s watch were asleep in the
forecastle, a considerable distance from the lazarette, but to
the captain, passengers, mate and steward, who occupied the after
house, the sensation was indeed awful.&nbsp; What wonder that the
screams of Mrs. Evans and Miss Blake rent the air?&nbsp; Or that
Captain Maxwell, experienced seaman that he was, found himself
utterly stunned and bewildered?&nbsp; But he was on deck in no
time, issuing orders with the confidence of one who has long been
accustomed to command.</p>
<p>Nothing so quickly restores our presence of mind in great
crises as the knowledge that others look to us for advice and <a
name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>help.&nbsp;
When the terrified Miss Blake rushed into her aunt&rsquo;s cabin,
it must be said to the widow&rsquo;s credit that she left off
screaming, and endeavored to pacify her niece.&nbsp; She tried to
think what Captain Evans would have done in such an emergency,
although having no clear idea as to what manner of evil had
befallen the vessel; and after hastily assuming her dressing gown
and slippers she issued forth with a boldness that surprised even
herself.</p>
<p>The sight that presented itself utterly confounded the good
woman, and it was only after passing her hand across her eyes
several times, that she could believe the evidence of her
senses.&nbsp; The cabin partition towards the stern was blown
entirely out, together with the companion-way, and skylight
above.&nbsp; The roof of the cabin had been splintered in places
and lifted up, until Mrs. Evans could see a patch of sky here and
there, while the floor under her feet was so uneven she could
hardly walk upon it.&nbsp; She stood holding to the center table,
blankly wondering what could have <a name="page155"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 155</span>happened, when the steward came from
Captain Maxwell&rsquo;s room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, steward, in the name of heaven, what has
happened?&nbsp; Are we sinking? Have we been pooped?&nbsp; Is the
bark stove to pieces on a rock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that bad, Madam Evans. There&rsquo;s no
rock in this part of the ocean, and if we&rsquo;re sinking
it&rsquo;s very slowly.&nbsp; Are you hurt?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; only badly frightened.&nbsp; I cannot realize yet
what is the matter.&nbsp; Is anyone killed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We can&rsquo;t tell yet, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; But I must
not stop here talking.&nbsp; The after wall of the
captain&rsquo;s room is blown out and the head of his bed torn
off.&nbsp; The room was set afire, too, and in putting it out he
burned his hands badly.&nbsp; Will you hold this lamp while I get
some linseed oil and batting?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Maxwell&rsquo;s injuries were more painful than
dangerous, and considerable relief was afforded as soon as Mrs.
Evans&rsquo; deft fingers had applied the dressing.&nbsp; He then
returned to the deck.&nbsp; It still lacked <a
name="page156"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 156</span>over two
hours of dawn, and the moon was low in the west.&nbsp; Total
darkness would soon descend, and there was much to be done.&nbsp;
Already the carpenter was at work on a new wheel, and the moment
it was in position the captain resolved to steer for Rio de
Janeiro, where repairs could be made.</p>
<p>The strong smell of powder, and the shattered timbers, left no
doubt in the captain&rsquo;s mind that an explosion of some sort
had caused the catastrophe.&nbsp; Fortunately, its greatest force
had been upward; otherwise the vessel&rsquo;s bottom might have
been blown out, thus ending her career and those of all on board
in short order.&nbsp; The signals in the lazarette were the only
explosives on board the bark, but how they could have become
ignited was not easily seen, unless a fire had started.&nbsp;
Everyone was on deck but the ladies; there was no more sleep that
night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Bohlman, you will muster all hands amidships, and
you and Mr. Freeman will then call the names of those in your
respective watches.&nbsp; Some one may <a
name="page157"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 157</span>have been
killed.&nbsp; Whose wheel was it at the time of the
accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Matt&rsquo;s, sir,&rdquo; answered Freeman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He was badly hurt by being blown against the
bulwarks.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ve put him in his bunk, and two hands
are rubbing him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While the crew were assembling, the captain questioned his
second mate closely as to whether he had noticed any signs of
fire about the after part of the vessel, or seen any person enter
the lazarette.&nbsp; Freeman was certain, however, that he should
have smelled smoke had there been any fire, while as for anyone
entering the place without being seen by himself or the man at
the wheel,&mdash;it was impossible.&nbsp; It will be remembered
that he had gone below just before Captain Maxwell discovered the
lighted lantern, and therefore knew nothing of that
circumstance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About how long was it after you left the quarter-deck
until the explosion took place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t five minutes, sir.&nbsp; I was going
forward to the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sl deck to see that everything
was all right, when, happening <a name="page158"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 158</span>to look in the port door of the
fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sl, I noticed the light was out.&nbsp; I stepped
in to see whether the lantern was empty or not, but found it
gone.&nbsp; Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You found the lantern gone!&rdquo; exclaimed the
captain, an idea striking him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you notice
whether Dick Lewis was gone, too?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Lewis?&nbsp; No, sir; why should I?&nbsp; It was
his watch below, and he was probably in his bunk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall see.&nbsp; Come with me to the main
deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All hands were assembled around the capstan in various degrees
of astonishment.&nbsp; Several of that motley crew had probably
been shipwrecked during various stages of their careers, but it
may be doubted whether any had ever witnessed an accident similar
to that which had just taken place.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Lewis, step forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s stern command produced a sensation, and
all hands wondered what was coming next.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dick Lewis, step forward!&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 159</span>The
words were repeated, but no response came from among the crowd of
men standing about in the raw morning air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That settles it,&rdquo; said the captain,
decisively.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sl be searched,
and every other part of the bark.&nbsp; If that boy is not to be
found, he has paid the penalty of his rashness.&nbsp; He may be
dead in the hold, or he may have been blown through the
quarter-deck and into the ocean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Freeman remembered the conversation of the previous afternoon,
when Dick had betrayed his curiosity regarding the signals.&nbsp;
Yes, the captain&rsquo;s theory must be correct, and he shuddered
to think how long the boy might have been at work in the
lazarette while he walked the deck above.&nbsp; But how had he
entered the place?&nbsp; Matt was not so badly hurt but that he
was able to swear no one had passed through the hatch, and he,
Freeman, had left the quarter-deck but twice during the watch,
and then only for a few minutes.&nbsp; The true solution of the
problem passed <a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
160</span>through the minds of Captain Maxwell, his mate and
second mate, at almost the same moment, but the two former at
first dismissed it as too improbable.&nbsp; Freeman, however,
insisted that Dick must have gotten into the lazarette, if at
all, by crawling all the way aft through the hold; and as Matt
insisted that no one had gone below by the usual way, this view
of the matter was the only possible one left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God only knows what ailed that boy,&rdquo; Captain
Maxwell said, as Dick&rsquo;s devilish ingenuity became apparent,
&ldquo;but he&rsquo;s found out by this time how those signals
work, and what twenty-five pounds of powder can do.&rdquo;</p>

161</span>CROSSING THE LINE.</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/p161.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

"Crossing the Line"

</a>After two weeks of tribulation, the barkentine <i>Mohawk</i>
was through the Atlantic Doldrums.&nbsp; The hot, murky
atmosphere, and the low-hanging rain-clouds that seem always
ready to open and let fall a deluge, were left behind, and the
fact that a breeze had blown from the same point of the compass
for three successive hours was another certain indication that
this tormenting region of calms, rain-squalls and variable winds
was a thing of the past.</p>
<p>When one bell struck, and the steward brought Captain Charles
Pitkin his morning cup of coffee, the skipper felt as <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
162</span>light-hearted as a boy, and knew, without looking at
the compass, that the craft was speeding along towards Buenos
Ayres, instead of drifting aimlessly about in the calm belt or
beating to the southeast against a head wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We ought to cross the Line to-day, at this rate,&rdquo;
he said to himself.</p>
<p>The steward heard the words, and made bold to say: &ldquo;Will
we, sir?&nbsp; I only wish Father Neptune would come aboard and
make subjects of those three lubbers in the
fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sl.&nbsp; They are the worst greenhorns I ever
did see.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean the two Swedes and the Austrian?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; especially that Christian Anderson, in the
mate&rsquo;s watch, that claimed to be able to steer and then
couldn&rsquo;t box the compass to save his life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain made no answer, and the steward withdrew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;George! it&rsquo;s not a bad idea,&rdquo; mused
Pitkin.&nbsp; &ldquo;It would do those three &lsquo;able
seamen&rsquo; good to meet the Old Man of the Seas, I honestly
believe.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 163</span>The
more thought he gave the matter, the better he liked it; and by
breakfast time, when the captain, his sister, and the mate
gathered about the table, the former had arranged in his mind the
principal details of the ceremonies which he decided should take
place that morning.</p>
<p>Miss Pitkin did not receive the narration of her
brother&rsquo;s plans with the approval he had expected; in fact,
she was in a decidedly unpleasant frame of mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Rosy, you seem out of sorts this morning.&nbsp; I
thought you&rsquo;d be pleased to hear that Neptune was coming
aboard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neptune, indeed!&nbsp; The Flying Dutchman will be the
next thing on the programme, I suppose.&nbsp; And as for being
out of sorts&mdash;Charles Pitkin, are you aware that this is the
first morning for two weeks that you have not resembled a
thundercloud?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps; but I&rsquo;ve had reason to look black.&nbsp;
Now the Doldrums are done with, I&rsquo;m as merry as a lark, and
you ought to be, too.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>&ldquo;You are mistaken.&nbsp; That beast of a cat has
killed my poor canary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Rose said this in a tone of mingled anger and grief,
looking hard at her coffee-cup meanwhile.&nbsp; She seldom
indulged in the feminine weakness of tears, or a few would
doubtless have been shed now as a tribute to the departed
canary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pshaw! that&rsquo;s too bad, Rose,&rdquo; said the
captain, sympathetically.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we kill the
cat?&nbsp; I detest the stealthy, cold-blooded creatures, and
this one does nothing but lie around in the sun all day instead
of catching rats.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Charles, we will not do that.&nbsp; I came near
throwing her overboard myself, but I suppose the creature was
only following her instincts.&nbsp; I must try and bear
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pitkin had celebrated some forty birthdays, but the years
had touched her lightly, and her charms, though mature, were not
inconsiderable.&nbsp; A plump, well-rounded figure, fresh
complexion, black eyes and hair, combined with regular features,
made an attractive whole, the one <a name="page165"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 165</span>serious blemish of which was an
habitual expression of firmness and decision which was so strong
as to be almost masculine.&nbsp; She had four brothers, all
younger than herself, and on the early death of their father and
mother, Rose assumed the cares of housekeeping and the bringing
up of the younger children.&nbsp; Thus she had come to be looked
up to by her brothers, and regarded rather in the light of a
parent than as a sister.</p>
<p>As they left the table she said: &ldquo;I am going to overhaul
the store-room.&nbsp; It needs to be done, and will keep me from
thinking of poor Goldie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you&rsquo;ll return to the deck when Neptune comes
aboard?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m in no humor for any such tomfoolery.&nbsp;
Perhaps, between you all, you may manage to get up a snowstorm,
or have an earthquake when we cross the Line.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But wait, Rosy, I want to ask a favor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lady vanished, and was soon delving among lime-juice,
guava jelly, apples, potted meats, and sundry other stores.</p>
<p><a name="page166"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 166</span>There
was something strangely incongruous in such a woman being
addressed by so childish and undignified a name as Rosy, but her
brother had so called her when scarcely able to toddle about, and
now that he was thirty, she was &ldquo;Rosy&rdquo; still.</p>
<p>Time was, when no craft of any description crossed the Equator
without having all the landsmen on board introduced to the royal
Neptune; but the good old custom has been gradually falling into
disuse, and in this prosaic age the ceremony of &ldquo;Crossing
the Line&rdquo; is rarely observed.</p>
<p>Captain Pitkin decided that Fritz, the carpenter, should be
metamorphosed into King Neptune&mdash;principally because he was
large and massive, and had a long, thick beard.&nbsp; Fritz was
an excellent carpenter, though his mental development was far
from being on a par with his physical.&nbsp; However, he would
look the part, and that was no small item.</p>
<p>His majesty always comes aboard with an attendant, and here it
was that Pitkin hit upon an original and brilliant idea.&nbsp; He
<a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 167</span>had been
humming an old song whose first verse runs:</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Twas Friday morn when we set
sail,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And we were not far from the land<br />
When the captain spied a lovely mermaid<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a comb and a glass in her hand.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>These words ran in his head some time, until he finally
exclaimed: &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll &lsquo;spy a mermaid,&rsquo;
too, though she may not be very lovely.&nbsp; Yes, a mermaid
shall come aboard this bark to-day with Father
Neptune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He congratulated himself upon this happy thought and set about
carrying it into execution.&nbsp; There was but one woman
aboard&mdash;his sister&mdash;and her assuming the role of
mermaid was, of course, not to be thought of.&nbsp; Among the
crew was a bright, good-looking fellow, known as Mike&mdash;just
the man to make an acceptable mermaid.&nbsp; In stature he was
somewhat below the medium height, but well proportioned and with
rather attractive features.&nbsp; He was much tanned, of course,
and his expression was decidedly bolder than is thought pleasing
in one of the fair <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>sex; but these were minor difficulties in comparison
with the great question, How to obtain suitable clothes?&nbsp;
The captain solved this, as he thought, by deciding to ask his
sister for the loan of some of her old skirts and waists, but she
had buried herself in the store-room before he had time to prefer
his request.&nbsp; This was just as well, he concluded, for in
her present humor he would have met with a peremptory
refusal.</p>
<p>So, having ascertained that Rose was engaged in hauling the
steward over the coals for misplacing a case of honey and leaving
matches where the rats could get at them, the captain entered his
sister&rsquo;s room.&nbsp; He felt rather guilty, but suitable
attire for the mermaid must be had, and he tried to think that
&ldquo;Rosy wouldn&rsquo;t mind,&rdquo;&mdash;hoping,
nevertheless, that the ceremonies would be over before she came
on deck.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What a lot of clothes women have,&rdquo; he
soliloquized, examining the various gowns and other apparel
hanging on pegs.&nbsp; His sister&rsquo;s best garments were laid
away <a name="page169"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 169</span>in
her trunks, and he spent considerable time in trying to choose
what seemed to be the least valuable skirt and waist among the
lot.&nbsp; He finally selected an old black alpaca for which Rose
cared little, and a red dressing jacket for which she cared a
great deal&mdash;it was the one she slipped on every morning when
combing her hair.&nbsp; Just as he was leaving a green veil
caught his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That will make Mike look mysterious,&rdquo; he
thought.&nbsp; He took it, bundled the things up in a newspaper,
and Mr. Rivers, the mate, conveyed them forward.</p>
<p>The morning was hot, but a fine breeze tempered the heat and
prevented discomfort.&nbsp; The seas chased each other along the
vessel&rsquo;s sides, and occasionally sobbed and gurgled in the
lee scuppers as the bark leaned over to port.&nbsp; Just as the
man at the wheel struck five bells, two strange figures climbed
over the bows and gained the forecastle deck.&nbsp; They were the
Old Man of the Seas and his companion.</p>
<p>The royal Neptune&rsquo;s head was encircled by an elaborate
wooden crown, painted <a name="page170"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 170</span>green, about which were twined
several pieces of sea-weed.&nbsp; His long beard was carefully
combed out, and swept down upon his chest with a truly
patriarchal air.&nbsp; The principal garment was a long green
toga (formerly a piano-cover), which extended from the neck to
the heels, and was ornamented with sea-weed stitched on in
various fantastic shapes.&nbsp; The arms and feet of the royal
personage were entirely bare, and in his right hand he carried a
substantial sceptre some five feet in length, having three prongs
at the upper end.</p>
<p>Neptune&rsquo;s companion was a sight to behold.&nbsp; From
the crown of her head to her waist, floated a wealth of yellow
hair, of which any mermaid might well have been proud.&nbsp; This
telling effect had been achieved by unbraiding and combing out
several strands of sennit.&nbsp; The dressing-jacket and the
alpaca skirt did not seem exactly &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; for a
sea-nymph, and yet they fitted as well as could have been
expected, except that the jacket was too tight across the
shoulders.&nbsp; A straw hat covered with sea-weed was perched
upon <a name="page171"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 171</span>the
damsel&rsquo;s head, and the green veil concealed the fact that
she had been freshly shaven.&nbsp; Her feet were encased in a
pair of knit slippers.&nbsp; Depending from a belt around her
waist were a small cracked hand-glass, a comb, and a flying-fish
which had fallen on the deck that morning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mariners, behold Neptune, the Ruler of the Seas, and
his daughter, the beautiful Mermaid of St. Paul&rsquo;s
Rocks!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neptune made this announcement in a deep bass voice, and
Captain Pitkin and the mate bowed low before the two august
personages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your majesty has conferred an unspeakable honor in
deigning to come aboard,&rdquo; answered Pitkin.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will it please you to accompany us to the main deck, where
some slight preparation has been made for your
reception?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain and mate led the way, followed by Neptune and his
daughter.&nbsp; The former held his head high in the air and
looked neither to the right nor to the left, while the Mermaid
walked with a mincing <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>gait and twined her long hair about
her fingers.</p>
<p>All hands were assembled in the waist, eager to see the siren
and her father, and as the quartette approached, the crew winked,
nudged each other, and cast meaning glances at the three
&ldquo;candidates,&rdquo;&mdash;Oscar, Christian and Josef, who
formed a little group by themselves.</p>
<p>A low platform had been constructed about the capstan, and
when Neptune took his seat upon the brass surface of the latter,
his appearance was really imposing.&nbsp; A cloth-covered box had
been provided for the Mermaid, but she disdained it, and leaned
gracefully against the throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what bold craft have we here, which thus invades
our domain and hopes to cross the Line with landsmen aboard, for
the wrinkles in this vessel&rsquo;s copper prove that more than
one lubber stands before us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neptune delivered this speech in accents of wrath, and brought
his sceptre down with such force that those nearest fell back a
few steps.</p>

<p><a name="page173"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
173</span>&ldquo;We are the barkentine <i>Mohawk</i>, sire, from
Portland for Buenos Ayres, and your majesty&rsquo;s keen
perception has not erred in assuming that there are landsmen
aboard.&nbsp; I cheerfully relinquish to you the freedom of the
vessel, and trust that all aliens here will shortly be
transformed into loyal subjects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain bowed and withdrew to the poop, where he had an
excellent view and could hear all that was said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let the landsmen come before us,&rdquo; commanded
Neptune.</p>
<p>But the trio hesitated, evidently not relishing the aspect of
affairs.&nbsp; All three possessed a certain amount of common
sense,&mdash;though mostly latent,&mdash;and half-suspected that
King Neptune and the carpenter were one and the same.&nbsp; But
the silent female figure puzzled them completely, for the
Mermaid, although unconventional in appearance, was so cleverly
arrayed that the illusion was quite perfect.</p>
<p>Josef timidly whispered a few words to Oscar, but before he
could reply, Neptune stamped his foot.&nbsp; Royalty cannot brook
<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>delay,
and at this token of displeasure, half a dozen of the crew seized
Oscar, Josef and Christian, and dragged them before the
throne.&nbsp; The two former were conducted to one side in
obedience to Neptune&rsquo;s gesture, while Christian remained
standing before the frowning monarch.</p>
<p>A slight hitch now occurred, caused by Neptune forgetting his
lines.&nbsp; He was unequal to the task of extemporizing, and the
more he tried to remember what &ldquo;came next,&rdquo; the more
confused he became.&nbsp; His majesty glared about, his face
meanwhile becoming red with embarrassment, which poor Christian
attributed to rage.&nbsp; The Mermaid was equal to the emergency,
and came to her father&rsquo;s rescue.</p>
<p>Mike was something of a ventriloquist, and when the order was
issued &ldquo;Minion, box the compass!&rdquo; Christian was not
the only one who stared in amazement, wondering whence the
strange voice proceeded.&nbsp; He had never been called by such a
name before, and was in much doubt as to <a
name="page175"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 175</span>whether he
was the one addressed.&nbsp; The Mermaid whispered something in
Neptune&rsquo;s ear, and the latter, tapping the culprit with his
sceptre, commanded: &ldquo;Answer, varlet, and
quickly!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The compass was a Chinese puzzle to Christian, <a
name="citation175"></a><a href="#footnote175"
class="citation">[175]</a> but he dared not remain silent, and
began desperately: &ldquo;North, northeast, east by north-east,
east by east,&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the crew set up a roar of derision, and the mate
remarked: &ldquo;A fine able seaman you are.&nbsp; The
shipping-master that put you aboard this bark ought to <a
name="page176"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 176</span>be sent
around the world as mate of a ship with two dozen like you for a
crew!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Neptune had by this time got his bearings, and asked:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Does the sun cross the equator on the 21st of June, or
the 21st day of December?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;June,&rdquo; hazarded Christian.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What route must a steamer take to go from New York to
Honolulu in eight days?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The middle route.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why is the gulf-stream always full of
sharks?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never knew the reason, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What year was the Panama Canal discovered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What time does the moon rise at the South
Pole?&rdquo;</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How many wrecks are there on the bottom between here
and Pitcairn Island?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There must be a good many, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Half a dozen equally absurd questions followed, most of which
the wisdom of <a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
177</span>Minerva could not have answered correctly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough; away with him to the shaving-chair!&rdquo;
finally cried Neptune.&nbsp; &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the most
unpromising subject we ever came across, and calls me
&lsquo;sir,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;your
majesty!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>An old steamer chair had been tilted back, and the
victim&mdash;for such he now considered himself&mdash;was marched
to it, and requested to sit down.&nbsp; Behind this chair stood a
large wash-tub filled with water, but the tarpaulin spread over
it concealed this fact.</p>
<p>The Mermaid now produced a tar-pot, in which she swished a
brush about until the &ldquo;lather&rdquo; was of the right
consistency.&nbsp; A piece of sacking having been spread over the
occupant of the chair, the operator brandished her brush and
prepared to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t need to&mdash;to be shaved,&rdquo; gasped
Christian.</p>
<p>This was true, for he was one of those men&mdash;mostly Finns
and <a name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>Scandinavians&mdash;who couldn&rsquo;t have raised a
beard had his life depended on it.&nbsp; A few colorless hairs
appeared on his cheeks and upper lip, which the Mermaid proceeded
to count aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Twenty-nine!&rdquo; she announced,
contemptuously.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rather different, father dear, from
the visages of Columbus, Magellan, and Vasco de Gama, upon whom I
operated in centuries gone by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She now lathered the face of the squirming Christian, laying
on the tar with the peculiar slapping sound made by an
experienced painter when applying a coat of paint to a flat
surface.</p>
<p>The patient had by this time resigned all hope, and betrayed
little interest when the brush was laid aside for the
razor.&nbsp; This was a marline-spike, and the Mermaid gave it an
edge&mdash;if a round object can be said to have an edge&mdash;by
stropping it on a capstan bar which one of the crew had placed in
the capstan.&nbsp; She then held the cracked hand-glass before
Christian&rsquo;s face, that he might see how he looked, and
proceeded to shave him.&nbsp; This was a <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>decided
relief, and the man wondered if it was not the end of the
performance.</p>
<p>Vain hope!&nbsp; Scarcely had the lather been scraped off,
when two of the crew advanced to the tub and removed the
tarpaulin.&nbsp; They then tipped the chair back suddenly,
causing its occupant to slide into the tub, where he was immersed
all but the feet.&nbsp; He was quickly drawn out and hustled
forward on the port side, directly beneath the fore yard.&nbsp; A
bowline had been rigged up at the extremity of the yard-arm
overhanging the water, and the ends of the rope hung down to the
deck.&nbsp; One end was made fast around Christian just beneath
the arms, and a dozen hands grasped the other end amidst the most
uproarious hilarity.</p>
<p>An old salt with bare feet, brass rings in his ears, and a red
cotton handkerchief wound about his head, now ascended to the
roof of the forward house and played a wild air upon a wheezy
violin.&nbsp; He danced about at the same time, and sang in a
hurricane voice and with great gusto, the first verse of a song
whose subject was: &ldquo;The <a name="page180"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 180</span>Baptism of Captain
Kidd.&rdquo;&nbsp; Everyone joined in the chorus, even Neptune
and his daughter, while the shrieking Christian was hoisted up to
the yard-arm.&nbsp; There he remained suspended between sea and
sky while the old salt rendered another verse, and then, as all
hands took up the refrain, the rope was slackened away.&nbsp;
Three times was the Swede ducked in the heaving swell, before
being drawn up and lowered on deck again.&nbsp; He was then
released, and patted on the back by the Mermaid, who said
patronizingly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;My son, you are a lubber no more,&mdash;in name at
least,&mdash;and can now consider yourself a true subject of
Neptune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new subject was past speech, but he drew a deep breath of
relief and got upon the galley roof, where he sat down to dry, as
well as to see what befell Oscar and Josef.&nbsp; He had not been
hurt in the least, but, as some one has said, &ldquo;A man might
as well be killed as scared to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The other two felt that their time had come.&nbsp; At first
they had watched the proceedings with great interest, which <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>gradually
changed to dismay, and finally gave place to absolute
terror.&nbsp; That Christian was to be hanged or drowned, they
did not in the least doubt; and just as he was ducked for the
third time, Oscar gave a yell and broke from his guards, who were
absorbed in watching the rites.&nbsp; He ran to the main rigging
and darted up it as though Satan were at his heels.&nbsp; The
guards were about to pursue, when they remembered Josef, and the
latter&rsquo;s break for liberty was nipped in the bud.</p>
<p>Neptune, the Mermaid and attendants now came aft, and many
volunteers presented themselves to bring Oscar down from the
top-mast head, whither he had climbed with an alacrity entirely
foreign to his nature.&nbsp; The royal personages consulted
together and announced that Josef would be &ldquo;finished&rdquo;
before Oscar was taken in hand.&nbsp; So everybody gathered about
the throne; even the cat, who sat gravely upon her haunches and
licked her chops as though desiring another canary.</p>
<p>A number of ridiculous questions were propounded to Josef, who
had a very <a name="page182"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
182</span>imperfect knowledge of English, and made worse work
than Christian in answering them.&nbsp; He was hurried to the
chair, and the tar-bucket again brought into requisition.</p>
<p>Meanwhile Miss Pitkin had inspected the store-room thoroughly,
and now came up the companion-way with a comfortable sense of
duty performed.&nbsp; She scanned the horizon line for a sail,
took a look at the compass, and then started to find her
brother.&nbsp; There he was on the poop, and she ascended
thither.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is the matter, Charles?&nbsp; Why are all
hands in the waist?&nbsp; Oh, I
remember,&mdash;Neptune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain was relieved at seeing his sister smile, and began
to hope that she was rallying from the grief and ill-temper into
which the canary&rsquo;s death had thrown her.&nbsp; Suddenly,
through the crowd of figures pressing around the throne, she
caught a glimpse of the Mermaid.&nbsp; Surprise at sight of this
extraordinary vision kept her silent a moment, when she called <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 183</span>out:
&ldquo;Mr. Rivers, what is that creature,&mdash;man or
woman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Mermaid&rsquo;s wit got the better of her discretion, and
she answered, before the mate could reply, &ldquo;Neither one,
ma&rsquo;am: I&rsquo;m &rsquo;alf and &rsquo;alf, like the ale
and stout we mix together in Liverpool, or like one of those
morphodite <a name="citation183"></a><a href="#footnote183"
class="citation">[183]</a> brigs, that&rsquo;s part brig and part
schooner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crew respectfully fell back at sight of Miss Pitkin, and
the nymph was exposed to view.&nbsp; Rose instantly detected the
deception, and in spite of the cleverly disguised voice, her
feminine facility for jumping at conclusions told her that Mike
was the speaker.&nbsp; Without knowing why, she was as absolutely
certain of this fact as of her own name.&nbsp; Then she
recognized the dressing jacket!&nbsp; The lady could hardly
believe the evidence of her senses; but it was not her habit to
remain in doubt if it could be avoided, and she hurried from the
poop to verify her suspicions.</p>
<p>The captain was considerably disturbed<a
name="page184"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 184</span>by the
expression of his sister&rsquo;s face, and called out:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do anything rash, Rosy; it&rsquo;s only a
mermaid.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hang that fool of a Mike,&rdquo; he muttered.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why couldn&rsquo;t he have kept quiet?&nbsp; I wish
I&rsquo;d never heard of mermaids or anything of the
sort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Miss Pitkin sought her room and took a hurried inventory of
her possessions.&nbsp; Yes, what she deemed impossible had
occurred; one of the crew had actually dared to invade the
sanctity of the cabin&mdash;her own room, even&mdash;and
deliberately steal her clothes!&nbsp; The theft, audacious as it
seemed, was yet of secondary importance compared to the
outrageous breach of discipline it involved.&nbsp; At this rate
the crew would soon want to dine with the captain, or sit in easy
chairs upon the quarter-deck!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And there sat my brother on the poop with his eyes
open, and never even noticed that that creature was wearing his
sister&rsquo;s clothes!&rdquo; she thought, surprise for the
moment taking the place of indignation.</p>
<p>She gained the main deck, and advanced towards the capstan,
where the ceremonies <a name="page185"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 185</span>had been resumed the moment she went
below.&nbsp; Her black eyes flashed ominously, and the crew, with
a common impulse, fled in all directions, though none could have
told precisely what they were fleeing from.&nbsp; The two mates
thought it prudent to withdraw to their rooms, and the guilty
Mermaid set down the tar bucket and escaped, leaving Josef in the
chair with but one side of his face lathered.&nbsp; Neptune alone
remained to face the enemy, not being actuated by bravery so much
as by astonishment at the sudden rout of his attendants.&nbsp;
While the Ruler of the Seas sat upon the throne trying to decide
what to do, Miss Pitkin stepped up and surveyed him with scornful
amusement.&nbsp; There was her green veil in his left hand,
whither it had been thrust by the Mermaid!</p>
<p>Unable longer to control her indignation, Rose seized the tar
brush, exclaiming, &ldquo;Take that, you great overgrown
dunce.&rdquo;&nbsp; Suiting the action to the word, she gave his
majesty&rsquo;s cheek a sound slap; which insult, instead of
rousing him, appeared to befog his faculties still more.&nbsp; <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 186</span>She plucked
the sceptre from the monarch&rsquo;s palsied hand, knocked the
crown from his head, and threw both overboard.</p>
<p>Neptune&rsquo;s daughter had taken refuge in the carpenter
shop, but the red jacket caught Miss Pitkin&rsquo;s eye as she
passed the window.&nbsp; Pursued and pursuer darted through the
room and out of the opposite door, but as Rose was used to skirts
and the nymph was not, the latter was at a disadvantage.&nbsp;
Thrice was she nearly thrown down by the alpaca, until gathering
it up in one hand, she dashed to the rigging, and attempted to
ascend.&nbsp; Miss Pitkin was close behind, and made a pass at
the Mermaid with a harpoon she had picked up; the end catching in
the damsel&rsquo;s hair, which all came off, together with her
hat.&nbsp; The looking glass fell to the deck and was shivered
into fragments.&nbsp; There was the erstwhile siren part way up
the rigging, all her wit, confidence and gayety gone; while the
very members of the crew who had so lately admired her, now
jeered and derided from the other side of the deck.</p>
<p><a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
187</span>&ldquo;It will go hard with you when we reach
port!&rdquo; cried the irate lady, when she had recovered her
breath; &ldquo;and if Captain Pitkin doesn&rsquo;t have you in
irons before night, he&rsquo;s not the man I take him for.&nbsp;
You brazen thief, to steal my clothes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never did steal a thing of anybody aft since I came
aboard, ma&rsquo;am.&nbsp; Do you think I&rsquo;d be going into
the cabin where I&rsquo;ve no business, and risk being
caught?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m no fool.&nbsp; The captain told me all I
had to do was to be a mermaid (may the Virgin forgive me), and
he&rsquo;d furnish the togs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that Captain Pitkin gave you those
clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sent them to the fo&rsquo;k&rsquo;sl, ma&rsquo;am,
this very morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would my brother do such a thing?&rdquo; Rose asked
herself, as she again took her way aft.</p>
<p>The captain was invisible.&nbsp; In fact, he had retired to
his room, and was endeavoring to banish the present by a perusal
of the fascinating adventures of D&rsquo;Artagnan <a
name="page188"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 188</span>and his
reckless companions.&nbsp; He was roused by a knock at the door,
but before he could say &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; his sister
entered.</p>
<p>The captain took in the situation at a glance, and knew he was
in for it.&nbsp; The years seemed to roll back, and as Rose
marched him to the sofa he imagined himself a boy of ten, and the
subject of well-merited chastisement.&nbsp; He made a full
confession, asked to be forgiven, and swore never again to hold
any intercourse with Neptune or his relatives.&nbsp; He could not
help adding: &ldquo;It was partly your fault, though, for if you
hadn&rsquo;t flounced out of the room at breakfast, I should have
had a chance to ask for the use of the clothes. Are they
completely ruined?&nbsp; Can&rsquo;t they be washed?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Are they ruined</i>?&nbsp; Do you suppose I will
ever touch them again after that Mike has worn them?&nbsp; And
have they not been in the forecastle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose whispered a single word in her brother&rsquo;s ear.&nbsp;
It was the name of a creature all mention of which is strictly
tabood in good society; or, if referred to at all, it <a
name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 189</span>is usually
between housewives exchanging confidences, and then only with
bated breath.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot name &rsquo;t but I shall
offend,&rdquo; and it suffices to say that it is a certain little
animal which invariably inhabits ships&rsquo; forecastles, though
on all well-regulated craft it never invades the cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good heavens, Rose, I never thought of that,&rdquo;
replied the captain, looking serious.&nbsp; &ldquo;But never
mind, it can&rsquo;t be helped, and you shall have what clothes
you want in Buenos Ayres, if you can find anything to
suit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rose was fond of her brother&mdash;in her own way,&mdash;and
his straight-forward confession mollified her considerably.&nbsp;
She did not yet allow this to appear, however, but announced
sternly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;After the manner in which you have made away with my
garments, Charles, I very much doubt whether I shall make another
voyage on the <i>Mohawk</i>.&nbsp; It would serve you right if I
left you to your own devices.&nbsp; You could mend your clothes,
lose your pipes, go without my desserts, <a
name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 190</span>and live on
hash and lobscouse for years to come, besides having the
satisfaction of knowing that the steward was secretly drinking
bottles of ale and beer, and making way with
provisions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain made a gesture as if to banish some disagreeable
remembrance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t, Rosy,&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t endure to
live the way I used to.&nbsp; It seemed all right then, but since
you&rsquo;ve taken the cook, and steward and cabin in hand,
it&rsquo;s like a different vessel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This admission pleased Rose, and she answered, &ldquo;Well, we
shall see,&rdquo; in tones which informed the captain that he was
forgiven.</p>
<p>He put his arm about his sister&rsquo;s waist and escorted her
to the deck, with a sensation of having recovered a treasure
whose worth had not been fully appreciated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s curious how one woman can upset everything,
and raise Pandemonium in no time,&rdquo; he said, aside to Mr.
Rivers, a few moments later.</p>
<p>Orders were given for the wash-tub to <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>be restored
to its proper place, the platform about the capstan to be
removed, and for everything to resume its wonted appearance.</p>
<p>As for Christian, Oscar and Josef, they might very
appropriately have been likened to the three degrees of
thankfulness.&nbsp; Christian, drying himself on the galley roof,
represented the positive degree, and was merely thankful that
Neptune had got through with him without taking his life.&nbsp;
Josef, with one cheek lathered, felt like a fish that has been
hooked, and then succeeds in escaping.&nbsp; He looked rather
woebegone, but was thankful indeed to have escaped with such
comparative comfort.&nbsp; But Oscar, who had now ventured part
way down the main mast, had fairly baffled Neptune and his
daughter; and had there been any degree beyond the superlative,
it could not have been too strong to express the state of his
feelings.&nbsp; Henceforth he regarded Miss Pitkin as a
deliverer, and had she been a goddess, his veneration could
scarcely have been greater.</p>
<p><a name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>The
<i>Mohawk</i> crossed the Line during the afternoon on the 30th
meridian of west longitude, and for all we know, Oscar and Josef
are lubbers yet.</p>

</a>The trades of the Indian Ocean usually blow with great
regularity except at the semi-annual change of the monsoons, and
the bark <i>Harvester</i> was slipping easily along at a six-knot
rate on her voyage from Singapore to New York.</p>
<p>It was the second dog-watch; that time at sea when, the
day&rsquo;s work being over, decks swept up, and supper eaten,
all hands bring out their pipes and gather in groups to discuss
passing events, or to while away the twilight hour in telling
stories.</p>
<p><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>Job,
the negro cook, sat in the galley door singing one of the
plaintive melodies of his race.&nbsp; An old banjo, played as
only a darky can play that instrument, furnished the
accompaniment.&nbsp; The singer&rsquo;s voice was rich and
mellow, and the simple notes floated out on the still evening air
with a soothing charm that went straight to the heart, and struck
many a forgotten chord in the breasts of the four rough seamen
who comprised his audience.&nbsp; Near the booby hatch were
gathered the mate, the bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un and the steward; each
relating in turn some reminiscence or bit of adventure connected
with his past life.&nbsp; Many of these provoked roars of
laughter, while the conclusion of a few was followed by a period
of silence rendered more eloquent by a shake of the head or a
sigh.&nbsp; That was the way these hardy men received the
narration of some half-forgotten ocean tragedy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Morgan,&rdquo; the steward was saying,
&ldquo;I recollect hearing of those two gales off Cape Flattery,
now you speak of it.&nbsp; About &rsquo;87, wasn&rsquo;t
it?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>The
mate thought a moment before he answered: &ldquo;It was in the
spring of &rsquo;87, in the first of those gales, that the ship
<i>St. Lawrence</i> went to the bottom.&nbsp; If I live to be a
hundred I&rsquo;ll never forget it; but if I should happen to,
here&rsquo;s something that&rsquo;ll make me remember.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pushed back the thick hair from his forehead and revealed
an ugly-looking scar of a peculiar reddish-brown color.
&ldquo;Now you know why I wear my hair long even in the
tropics,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve not got much
beauty to boast of, maybe, but I&rsquo;m a little sensitive about
that cursed mark all the same.&nbsp; I hate to think of
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The steward seemed astonished.&nbsp; &ldquo;The <i>St.
Lawrence</i>!&nbsp; You were on that ship, Mr. Morgan?&rdquo; he
exclaimed, in accents that betrayed his incredulity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was mate of her on her last four voyages.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were in Antwerp at the time, but I always understood
that all hands were lost with her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All but the carpenter and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 196</span>He
rose, emptied his pipe, and appeared anxious to drop the subject,
but the curiosity of the steward led him to ask how those two had
managed to escape.&nbsp; The bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un seconded the
request, so Morgan again seated himself, and after a short
silence related the affair in these words:</p>
<p>The <i>St. Lawrence</i> was a neat little ship&mdash;you may
have seen her,&mdash;and Captain Fairley was one of the finest
men I ever met,&mdash;quiet, and a man of few words, but when he
said a thing he meant it.&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t like his wife so
well, but his daughter, Miss Marion,&mdash;oh, she was a lovely
girl.&nbsp; She&rsquo;d never lived on shore much, and had that
shy, retiring disposition that you often see in such cases, where
the captain&rsquo;s children always go with him and have nobody
of their own age to associate with.&nbsp; She never hankered
after shore life though, and seemed perfectly happy to be always
at sea.</p>
<p>Miss Marion had quite a liking for me, and many and many an
evening would she pace the deck in my watch, telling me the names
of the different stars and how far <a name="page197"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 197</span>off some of them were, and all such
things.&nbsp; That was her favorite study&mdash;astronomy. Then
she read a great deal and used to tell me about her books.&nbsp;
All the tidies for the cabin chairs were made by her hands.&nbsp;
You remember that silk handkerchief I showed you,&mdash;that one
with the <i>M</i> embroidered on it?&nbsp; She worked that letter
and gave me the handkerchief on my birthday.&nbsp; It was the
first birthday present I ever got, and I guess it&rsquo;ll be the
last. Poor girl! she wasn&rsquo;t quite seventeen when the
accident happened.</p>
<p>We came across from Hong Kong to San Francisco and found that
the ship had been chartered to load coal on Puget Sound.&nbsp; We
arrived at Nanaimo near the end of March.&nbsp; In those days
there were no stevedores at most of the coal ports on the Sound,
and it was the captain&rsquo;s or mate&rsquo;s business to
superintend the work of the crew in loading the vessel.&nbsp;
Captain Fairley had to go to Tacoma on some business matter, and
as ill-luck would have it, I was taken sick the day after we got
to Nanaimo, and the doctor made me <a name="page198"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 198</span>turn in.&nbsp; I wasn&rsquo;t able
to get out of that bunk for ten days, with the result that the
second mate had charge of loading the ship.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t say anything here against Ike Summers,&mdash;all
of us have our failings,&mdash;but what I do say is this: his
being drunk while she was loading caused one of the worst
accidents on record, and the loss of one of the finest ships I
ever saw.&nbsp; Half of the crew were drunk of course, and
twenty-six hundred tons of coal were pitched in at random.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;ll swear she wasn&rsquo;t half trimmed, though I was just
able to get about the morning we sailed.&nbsp; Captain Fairley,
his wife and Miss Marion got back from Tacoma the afternoon
before, and I told him that night it was my opinion that the
second mate had been drinking a good deal.&nbsp; He looked
serious, but Ike swore everything was all right,&mdash;he&rsquo;d
got pretty well sobered up that afternoon,&mdash;and as the
clearance papers had been taken out, the captain concluded to
sail next day.&nbsp; He wanted to get to San Francisco as quickly
as possible, for we&rsquo;d <a name="page199"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 199</span>been chartered to load from there to
New York.&nbsp; If it hadn&rsquo;t been for that, I&rsquo;ve
always thought the captain would have looked into the way the
cargo had been stowed.&nbsp; He must have suspected something was
wrong, for he wanted Mrs. Fairley and Miss Marion to go back by
rail, but they wouldn&rsquo;t hear of it.</p>
<p>So we were towed to sea one fine April morning, having for
company a crazy old bark named the <i>Lizzie Williams</i>.&nbsp;
The <i>St. Lawrence</i> was rated A-1 at Lloyd&rsquo;s, and that
bark probably had no rating at all, but the old hulk was a good
deal more fit to go to sea that morning than we were, as it soon
turned out.&nbsp; Her cargo was stowed right, even if she did
have to be pumped out three times a day.</p>
<p>Ike Summers had the afternoon watch, and when I turned in
after dinner the tug had just cast us off, and there was hardly a
cloud in the sky.&nbsp; I heard Captain Fairley tell his wife
that we must be going to have a blow on account of the falling
glass, but he thought it wouldn&rsquo;t amount to much.&nbsp;
Miss Marion was doing some <a name="page200"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 200</span>fancy work, I remember, and Ike had
just ordered some of his men to spread an old cro&rsquo;-jack out
on deck to be mended.&nbsp; It was a warm, pleasant day, and the
sun shone on the sails of the <i>Lizzie Williams</i> as she
slumped along like an old canal boat a few miles to
leeward.&nbsp; She was the last thing I saw before I went to my
room and turned in.&nbsp; I soon dropped off, being dead tired
and not very strong yet after my sickness.</p>
<p>How long my sleep lasted don&rsquo;t matter,&mdash;it seemed
about ten minutes, but must have been several hours,&mdash;when I
was roused by the steward shaking me and yelling &ldquo;Come on
deck, Mr. Morgan, for God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo;&nbsp; That brought
me to my senses in an instant, and only stopping to throw on my
shoes, I ran out.</p>
<p>What a change!&nbsp; A heavy squall was bearing down, and all
hands were working like demons to get the ship stripped.&nbsp;
Some were aloft cutting away the earings so as to let the sails
go overboard, while others were letting go halyards, sheets and
tacks. A kind of fog or mist was settling down, <a
name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 201</span>and the
sails slatting against the masts and shrouds made a horrible din,
to say nothing of the hoarse orders that the captain and Ike were
bawling out.</p>
<p>I ran up the shrouds to help Summers cut away the
mains&rsquo;il.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good G&mdash;, Ike, you must have been mad to let that
squall catch the ship with all sail on.&nbsp; Where was the
captain?&rdquo; I cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was below.&nbsp; I just called him.&nbsp; It came
faster than I reckoned on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done it this time!&nbsp; If we
ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t dismasted it won&rsquo;t be your
fault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We got the mains&rsquo;il loose, and I had just slid down the
backstay to the deck when Miss Marion came running up with face
as white as a sheet, but perfectly cool.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me what I can do to help,&rdquo; she implored.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the lazarette hatchway,&rdquo; I answered,
&ldquo;and see all the cabin windows and skylights shut.&nbsp;
Then stay below.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Fairley was a very nervous woman, and the suddenness of
the affair had upset her completely.&nbsp; There she stood at the
<a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 202</span>break of
the poop clinging to a tops&rsquo;il brace, and literally
paralyzed with terror.&nbsp; Miss Marion went to her
mother&rsquo;s assistance, and at the same moment the captain
ordered me to take my watch and haul up the fores&rsquo;il.&nbsp;
They were the last words I ever heard him speak.</p>
<p>All this had happened within two or three minutes of my coming
on deck, and but few of the light sails had been cut away when I
got some of my watch at work on the fores&rsquo;il.&nbsp; The
first thing I knew, an extra heavy gust struck the ship and
heeled her over about twenty-five degrees.&nbsp; That
wasn&rsquo;t much, but I tell you a lump came in my throat the
next second when I heard a dull roar in the hold beneath.&nbsp;
All of us knew what that muffled sound meant&mdash;the cargo had
shifted!</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p202.jpg">
<img alt=
"&ldquo;The ship went clear over on her side&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;The ship went clear over on her side&rdquo;"
 src="images/p202.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Of course the ship went clear over on her side then, and the
squall broke on us in earnest right after.&nbsp; Everybody
grasped whatever he could lay his hands on to keep from sliding
down the deck.&nbsp; There was no sea running to speak of, and
the chances of saving the ship were fair <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>provided
the squall soon passed over; but as the thought of Ike Summers
having caused all this came over me, I was in such a fury that if
he&rsquo;d been near by then, I could have pitched him overboard,
and not been sorry.</p>
<p>I won&rsquo;t speak of what we all felt as we clung there on
different parts of the ship,&mdash;it had all been so sudden, but
before anything could be done to right her, the main mast broke
off underneath the deck, ripping her all open amidships.&nbsp;
The water poured in at an awful rate, and all hands knew the ship
was doomed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The boats!&nbsp; Cut the lashings before she
founders!&rdquo; I yelled.</p>
<p>Myself and two or three more sprang up on the forward house,
where three of the life-boats were made fast, and as we whipped
out our knives I happened to look aft and saw the captain and
steward on the poop trying to get the gig free before the ship
went down.&nbsp; Miss Marion and her mother were holding to the
spanker boom, both bearing up nobly in this awful crisis.&nbsp; I
knew they would be safe in the <a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>gig along with the captain, which
was a great load off my mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall we get water and stores for the boats?&rdquo;
someone cried.</p>
<p>How, indeed?&nbsp; It was impossible.</p>
<p>We had just got one boat free when the ship gave a plunge, and
we felt her going.&nbsp; Everyone was tugging at the boats; a few
were yelling and screaming; and then all hands were in the
water.&nbsp; I had hardly come to the surface when I felt a
terrible blow on the head, and dimly realized that a piece of
wreckage had struck me.&nbsp; There was a gurgling sound in my
ears,&mdash;that was the last thing I recollect.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I was lying on my back with my eyes open looking up at the
sky.&nbsp; The new moon was shining, and a large bright star
twinkled not far away.&nbsp; I vaguely felt that one of my hands
was in the water, and knew that my limbs were being chafed by
some person.&nbsp; A kind of dreamy stupor was on me, and though
these ideas passed slowly through my brain, they seemed to <a
name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 205</span>make no
impression, and I didn&rsquo;t even wonder where I was, or how I
came there.&nbsp; Some one spoke to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morgan, try and brace up a bit.&nbsp; You know
Simms, the carpenter&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice sounded strange and unnatural.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know Simms, the carpenter,&rdquo; I muttered;
but the words meant no more to me than does some senseless phrase
to the parrot that mechanically repeats it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Them&rsquo;s the first words you&rsquo;ve spoke,
sir.&nbsp; Now let me pour a little whiskey down your
throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The whiskey must have done me good, for I began to get my
senses back after a while and became conscious of a terrible
throbbing in my head.&nbsp; Putting my hand to my forehead where
the pain was, my fingers came in contact with blood.&nbsp; That
brought me round more than anything else, and I shut my eyes and
tried hard to remember where I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Morgan, it won&rsquo;t do to give up like
this.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t be over sixty miles <a
name="page206"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 206</span>from the
coast, and right in the track of the coal fleet at
that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The voice sounded familiar now, and I knew it was the
carpenter speaking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How did we come here, and where are the rest?&nbsp;
Where is the ship?&rdquo; I asked, still a good deal
bewildered.</p>
<p>There was a groan and a short pause before the answer
came.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No mortal man will ever set eyes on the <i>St.
Lawrence</i> again, Mr. Morgan, nor on any of her crew but you
and me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It took me some minutes to realize those awful words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Captain Fairley and his family&mdash;they
escaped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All gone, sir; all but us two.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How were we saved?&rdquo; I asked, as soon as my mind
had grasped the fact that out of two dozen lives, ours alone had
been spared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Everything was sucked down in the vortex&mdash;boats
and all.&nbsp; I held my breath till I nearly burst before I came
to the surface, and there you was close beside me.&nbsp; You was
just going down again, I <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>judged, when I grabbed you.&nbsp; A
good ways off was Jim Parsons, but not another soul was to be
seen.&nbsp; Two capstan bars floated near by, but I struck out
for this big piece of the poop-deck that we&rsquo;re on now,
which was half a ship&rsquo;s length off.&nbsp; It must have been
wrenched loose when she went down.&nbsp; I made shift to get on
it after a hard fight, for I daren&rsquo;t leave go of you for
fear you&rsquo;d sink.&nbsp; You was so limp I allowed you must
be dead, and your head was bloody besides.&nbsp; Then I looked
for Jim, but the poor fellow was nowhere to be seen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I owed my life to the carpenter, that was certain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t thank me any more,&rdquo; said the brave
fellow.&nbsp; &ldquo;You&rsquo;d have done as much for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How long have we been here?&rdquo; I said. &ldquo;Is
this the first night after the accident?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir; this time yesterday the ship was at
Nanaimo.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed incredible.&nbsp; A mere squall had wrecked that
fine ship&mdash;a blow not one twentieth part as strong as she
had <a name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
208</span>weathered hundreds of times before&mdash;and all on
account of a shifted cargo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any water to drink?&rdquo;&nbsp; I knew very
well there couldn&rsquo;t be, yet I asked the question.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Mr. Morgan.&nbsp; I happened to have this flask and
an apple in my pocket, which is all we&rsquo;ve got.&nbsp; If we
were in mid-ocean now, our logs would soon be wrote up, but I
make no doubt we&rsquo;ll be picked up in a day or so at the
most.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s no sea on, so our chance is
good.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We didn&rsquo;t talk much for a long time, but just before
daylight the carpenter, who had been standing up, said:
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be excited, sir, but there&rsquo;s a vessel
bearing down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where away?&nbsp; Point her out!&rdquo;&nbsp; I
struggled up, though it made my head swim.</p>
<p>None but a sailor would have recognized a vessel in that dark
blotch away in the north.&nbsp; My heart thumped pretty loud when
I sighted it, and realized that the craft was coming our
way.&nbsp; We prayed <a name="page209"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 209</span>for daylight,&mdash;or I did,
anyway,&mdash;and it was the first prayer I&rsquo;d said for
years.</p>
<p>Well, the sun came up, and there was a large Englishman not
four miles off.&nbsp; She couldn&rsquo;t help seeing us, but we
never stopped waving the carpenter&rsquo;s coat&mdash;I had
none&mdash;till they signalled us.&nbsp; No need to tell how we
got picked up, or how glad we were to have a ship&rsquo;s deck
under our feet again.&nbsp; She proved to be the <i>Scottish
Glens</i>, bound from Tacoma to Hamburg, and all hands were
mightily interested in our story, several having seen the <i>St.
Lawrence</i> sail the morning before.</p>
<p>There we were not a hundred miles from shore, but of course
the captain wouldn&rsquo;t put back, so there was nothing for it
but to start on an eighteen-thousand-mile voyage.&nbsp; We worked
our passage, and an awful one it was as far as length goes.</p>
<p>While entering the harbor of Hamburg, one hundred and ninety
days later, a small boat came alongside with mail for the
officers and crew.&nbsp; There was a large assortment of letters
and papers bearing <a name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
210</span>postmarks from all parts of the world; but the
carpenter and I got nothing, nor did we expect anything, for our
relatives must have long since given us up.&nbsp; One of the
officers handed me a late copy of the Marine Register, and in the
department of Disasters I found this item, which sounded like my
obituary:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">MISSING.</p>
<p>St. Lawrence (ship), Fairley, which sailed from Puget Sound
April 7 for San Francisco, has never been heard of since, and is
supposed to have foundered with all hands.&nbsp; Posted at
Lloyd&rsquo;s as missing.</p>

DANGEROUS CARGO.</h2>
<p>
<a href="images/p211.jpg">
<img class='floatleft' alt=

</a>The south-east trades of the Pacific usually carry the north
bound vessel well across the Line.&nbsp; But they had been
failing gradually for some days; and now the long, low steel hull
of the British ship <i>Lochleven</i> had almost ceased to move,
although she was yet a good two degrees south of the
equator.&nbsp; It was very provoking; the more so that she had
made very fast time thus far, and Captain Stafford had
entertained hopes of making an unusually quick passage.&nbsp; But
these hopes were slowly vanishing.</p>
<p>The remarkable feature of a calm in the equatorial latitudes
of the Pacific is the interesting appearance of the water, which
literally teems with various forms <a name="page212"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 212</span>of animal life.&nbsp; It is clear
and limpid as crystal, and, viewed from the
<i>Lochleven&rsquo;s</i> deck, an endless procession of strange
creatures slowly floated by with the current.&nbsp; Two shapeless
blotches of film appeared, whose only sign of life was a great
red eye at one end.&nbsp; They seemed to have less than the
consistency of jelly, and represented one of the lowest forms of
animal life.&nbsp; Next was a curious jointed creature of a deep
orange tint, coiled up like a snake.&nbsp; Then a fragile
nautilus was borne along, with the delicate pink shell projecting
above the surface like a sail,&mdash;&ldquo;Portuguese
man-of-war&rdquo; seamen call it,&mdash;while a bunch of long
tentacles hung down beneath.&nbsp; Just over the stern were two
active little fish the size of a brook trout, whose bodies were
blue, with wide brown stripes.&nbsp; The pair swam side by side,
occasionally darting away capriciously, only to return in a
moment.&nbsp; How harmless and innocent they looked!&nbsp; And
yet their presence was a certain indication that a shark lurked
beneath the ship.&nbsp; One or two of these pilot-fish always
accompany a shark to find his prey and lead him to it, for their
ugly protector is lazy and nearsighted, and would fare badly
without them.&nbsp; Close to the ship&rsquo;s side a <a
name="page213"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 213</span>magnificent
dolphin floated motionless in the translucent water; the beauty
of his steel-blue and pale lemon tints being enhanced by the
clear element until the splendid creature seemed too glorious to
be real.&nbsp; So quiet was the ocean, so still the fish, that
one might easily imagine it only the image of a dolphin reflected
in a vast mirror.</p>
<p>Several hundred miles to the eastward of where the
<i>Lochleven</i> lay becalmed were the Galapagos Islands, where
thousands of turtles assemble, lay their eggs in the sand, and
then float away with the current; sleeping on the water most of
the time.&nbsp; A dozen were now in view at various distances
from the ship, besides a big one that had just been captured, and
was crawling awkwardly about the deck.&nbsp; Its great discolored
shell, dead-looking eyes, and beak massive enough to sever a
man&rsquo;s wrist, gave little indication of the rich steaks and
agreeable soup into which the cook promised to convert it on the
morrow.</p>
<p>Howard, the captain&rsquo;s seven year old son, considered the
turtle a new kind of steed, and bestrode its broad back in great
glee.&nbsp; The bare-footed youngster was brown as a berry, and
carried a toy sailor which had been christened Lord Nelson.&nbsp;
<a name="page214"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 214</span>The fact
that his lordship was minus an arm only increased the affection
with which he had been regarded for two years past, when he
supplanted a golden haired doll, which Howard soon after
consigned to a watery grave.</p>
<p>Captain Stafford had been standing by the main hatch, watching
the turtle, and seeing to it that his reckless son did not get a
finger bitten off, when he became sensible of a faint, almost
imperceptible odor.&nbsp; It was so vague as to be almost
intangible&mdash;probably not half a dozen on board would have
noticed it even had they stood where the captain did then.&nbsp;
At first he tried to think it might be only imagination, and this
view of the matter was strengthened when he walked to another
part of the deck not far off and detected no odor whatever.&nbsp;
He returned to his former position and sniffed the air as a hound
does when scenting danger.&nbsp; Again that slight smell of
gas.</p>
<p>Captain Stafford knew what sort of a cargo was stowed under
his feet, and from that moment he thought no more of the
turtle.&nbsp; Walking to the carpenter-shop, he beckoned to its
occupant.&nbsp; &ldquo;Carpenter, get the main hatch off at
once.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cardiff coal is extraordinarily liable to <a
name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 215</span>spontaneous
combustion, and not a few of the many ships that carry it from
Cardiff and Swansea all over the world catch fire.&nbsp; Often
the danger is discovered in time to be checked, but one of the
peculiarities of this cargo is, that it may burn for days and
even weeks in the center of the mass without giving the least
sign, only to break forth at last in uncontrollable fury.&nbsp;
The <i>Lochleven</i> carried 4,000 tons of this commodity,
consigned to San Francisco.</p>
<p>The carpenter brought out his tools and began removing the
hatch-cover, while such of the crew as were aloft &ldquo;tarring
down&rdquo; the rigging wondered what this unusual proceeding
meant.&nbsp; The moment the aperture was laid open the nostrils
of those who looked down were saluted by a smell like that of a
sulphur match that has been lighted and then immediately
extinguished.&nbsp; It was not overpowering, and the captain was
the first man to descend the ladder.&nbsp; The carpenter followed
with an iron testing-rod, and then the mate, with several of his
watch.&nbsp; The latter were equipped with spades.&nbsp; Placing
his hand upon the coal, the captain found it slightly warm on the
surface, and the crew commenced digging according to his
directions.&nbsp; Then the carpenter inserted the <a
name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>testing-rod, which was withdrawn presently, and showed
that no fire existed thereabout, although the coals were badly
heated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, carpenter, take off the other hatches, and use the
tester in the other parts of the ship.&nbsp; And you, Mr.
Maitland, get the rest of your watch down from aloft.&nbsp; Let
them bring below every spade on board, and dig trenches wherever
the coal is heated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain&rsquo;s lungs were not strong and he was seized
with a fit of coughing, brought on by inhaling gas.&nbsp; This
compelled him to go on deck for a time, and he saw Mrs. Stafford
approaching.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is wrong, Edward, and why are the hatches being
opened?&nbsp; You look troubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nothing serious, I hope.&nbsp; The cargo is badly
heated, but we find no fire as yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Stafford glanced at her husband interrogatively, as if to
divine whether he concealed anything.&nbsp; She was a woman of
commanding presence, and though hardly thirty-five, her abundant
hair was perfectly white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no smoke,&rdquo; she said, looking down into
the hold.</p>
<p><a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 217</span>Even
as she spoke the carpenter removed the third hatch, and instantly
a thin, yellowish vapor ascended into the air.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a bad sign,&rdquo; said McKenzie, the third
mate, aside to the carpenter, who was preparing to descend.&nbsp;
But he drew back, holding his nose, and before it was possible to
go down a wet sponge had to be bound over his mouth and
nostrils.&nbsp; Those who accompanied him took the same
precaution.</p>
<p>It was nearly noon, and time to take sights.&nbsp; Still no
wind, and the rudder-chains creaked and rattled as though to
remind everyone that a calm prevailed.</p>
<p>While Captain Stafford waited for the sun to reach the zenith,
the carpenter approached, with a serious face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There looks to be a fire, sir, in hatch No. 3.&nbsp;
The further down the men dig the hotter the coal gets, and the
smoke is so much thicker we can hardly keep at work.&nbsp; All
hands are digging trenches, but I&rsquo;m afraid, sir, that
opening the hatches is making it worse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Begin now and pump water into the trenches.&nbsp; We
will see what effect that has.&nbsp; I shall be there as soon as
possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He hardly dared to think what would become of the ship in case
it should prove <a name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
218</span>impossible to subdue the fire.&nbsp; She was a fine new
vessel, having been built on the Clyde only two years
before.&nbsp; Should a fair wind spring up and the fire continue
to burn inwardly, there might be some hope of making Callao or
Panama, and thus saving the ship; but here they were in a dead
calm, at a place where a steady wind of any sort was practically
out of the question.</p>
<p>All the afternoon water was pumped into the hold, being led
over the coal by means of the trenches, and when pumping ceased
early in the evening it appeared to have done much good.&nbsp;
The coal in the main hatch was cooled off, and the smoke had
disappeared from the one next to it.&nbsp; But the morning would
prove whether the fire was to be subdued or not, and the crew
were ordered to bring up their mattresses and sleep on
deck.&nbsp; Then all the hatches were tightly battened down in
order to exclude air from the hold, and supper was served two
hours later than usual.&nbsp; But no one in the cabin except
Howard was able to do justice to the turtle-steak, the others
hardly knowing what was before them.&nbsp; Anxiety and suspense
destroy appetite, and not until morning arrived would it be known
whether or not the fire had <a name="page219"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 219</span>the ship at its mercy.&nbsp; If the
coal was merely heated and not actually burning, the water pumped
on it would probably suffice to avert combustion.&nbsp; The fact
of the vapor having vanished was of little importance&mdash;the
exterior of a volcano may be treacherously fair and peaceful at
the very moment the interior is a mass of molten fire.</p>
<p>Howard turned in at the usual time.&nbsp; He vaguely
understood that something was wrong, and wondered why all were so
grave.&nbsp; But the boy saw neither fire nor smoke, and his
childish mind had not yet grasped the peril which threatened the
ship.&nbsp; Clad in his white nightgown, he knelt at his
mother&rsquo;s knee; and, burying his face in her lap, said the
evening prayer she had taught.&nbsp; He repeated the words more
slowly than usual, and after reaching &ldquo;Amen&rdquo;
continued earnestly, &ldquo;God, don&rsquo;t let us be burned up,
and please let us catch another turtle to-morrow.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Then he ran into his little room next to that of his parents, and
bounded into bed in a way that made the slats rattle.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later, when Mrs. Stafford stole in on tip-toe, the
child was sleeping peacefully; the bed-clothes were all kicked
off, and the cherished figure of Lord <a name="page220"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 220</span>Nelson&mdash;without which he never
went to sleep&mdash;had just fallen from one little hand.&nbsp;
There he lay in the sweet forgetfulness of childhood, while his
mother stood beside him thinking of the many nights he had slept
in that little bed; in storm and calm, in heat and cold, in the
Atlantic, in the Pacific, in the Indian Ocean.&nbsp; How many
more nights would he sleep there?&nbsp; She softly imprinted a
kiss on the tanned forehead, and left the room with moist
eyes.&nbsp; Ascending to the quarter-deck, she lay down in a
hammock underneath the awning.</p>
<p>Captain Stafford and William Wells, the second mate, were
standing by the rail discussing the chances of saving the ship,
and speaking of other vessels that had caught fire under similar
conditions.&nbsp; One, a large British ship, called the
<i>Kenilworth</i>, had been abandoned after being burned entirely
out inside.&nbsp; She was afterwards picked up, towed into San
Francisco, and sold at auction.&nbsp; An American firm was the
purchaser; she was rebuilt, and is sailing the seas to-day under
the stars and stripes.&nbsp; Another, less fortunate, was
entirely consumed in the South Pacific, her officers and crew
escaping to the island of Juan Fernandez.</p>
<p><a name="page221"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 221</span>The
two men thought Mrs. Stafford was asleep, but she heard every
word, and the relation of these disasters depressed her spirits
exceedingly.&nbsp; She struggled with this feeling, for she was
not a woman to despair easily, and at length succeeded in
forgetting everything in a deep, dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>Dawn put an end to suspense.&nbsp; Through two of the closed
hatches a thin cloud of smoke was filtering, proof conclusive
that fire had been slowly consuming the cargo for days and days
past.&nbsp; Now it was eating its way to the surface The hatches
were opened, but dense clouds of hot, suffocating yellow smoke
belched forth, driving all back.&nbsp; It was overpowering, and
they were covered up again as fast as possible.&nbsp; It was
useless to pump more water into the hold, for the removal of the
hatches, by creating a draft, would simply fan the fire.&nbsp;
Nothing but a miracle could now save the ship.</p>
<p>Orders were given for the crew to bring all the stores and
provisions up from below,&mdash;all their bedding, sea-chests,
and whatever else there was in the fore peak.&nbsp; The smell of
gas down there was intolerable, and besides, it was necessary to
keep every hatch closed in order to smother the <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>fire as
much as possible.&nbsp; When everything had been brought up, the
cover was put on and secured, and the seams caulked with
oakum.</p>
<p>One of the apprentices did not realize until it was too late,
that the crew must live entirely on deck from that time forth;
evidently supposing it would be possible to go below again after
an interval.&nbsp; When he discovered his mistake the boy asked
to be allowed to fetch his sea-chest, but the hatch was secured
permanently, and his request had to be refused.&nbsp; He was the
only son of a widowed mother, who had fitted him out finely on
this, his first voyage, and tears filled his eyes when he thought
of all the things she had made for him with so much care.</p>
<p>The calm continued&mdash;there was no sign of the longed for
wind.&nbsp; Several men were kept aloft all day to scan the
horizon for a sail, even the captain ascending the rigging; but
not a solitary object was in sight.</p>
<p>The endless procession of yesterday floated by with horrible
monotony.&nbsp; The red-eyed blotches of film, the jelly-fish,
the orange-colored snakes, the large turtles asleep on the water
or paddling slowly about,&mdash;it was precisely the same.&nbsp;
The <a name="page223"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
223</span>previous day the water and its strange inhabitants had
possessed a fascinating interest to many of those on the ship;
now this same scene of tranquil beauty had become an
aggravation.&nbsp; As Mrs. Stafford&rsquo;s anxious eyes fell on
these curious sluggish creatures contentedly floating with the
current, she wondered absently whether they derived any pleasure
from such a passive and aimless existence.&nbsp; The two
pilot-fish still swam by the counter; the invisible shark still
lurked beneath the ship; the dolphin alone, was gone.</p>
<p>It was the Sabbath,&mdash;usually a day of perfect rest on the
<i>Lochleven</i>, for Captain Stafford was a man of strong
religious convictions.&nbsp; Every soul on board, from Mrs.
Stafford and Howard down to the apprentices, was required to be
present at the Sunday morning services.&nbsp; In pleasant weather
these exercises were conducted on the main deck, where all hands
were accustomed to assemble at six bells (11 o&rsquo;clock), but
to-day was an exception, for the crew was hard at work.</p>
<p>Every deep-water ship, before she reaches port after a long
voyage, is thoroughly cleaned and painted from stern to
stern.&nbsp; This is a job requiring at least a couple of
weeks.&nbsp; The <i>Lochleven</i> had <a name="page224"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 224</span>expected to reach San Francisco
within a month, and ship-cleaning was nearly completed at the
time the fire was discovered.&nbsp; The iron yards and lower
masts were freshly painted, the wooden top-masts and top-gallant
masts had been scraped, sand-papered and oiled, the rigging
tarred down, the life-boats and deck-houses cleaned and painted,
and the decks holystoned and oiled up to the top notch.</p>
<p>Now each man in the crew was working as only desperate men
can, to heave overboard every inflammable article about the
ship.&nbsp; Buckets of tar and paint; cans of benzine and linseed
oil; spare spars and planks; empty barrels; old sails; oakum and
sennit;&mdash;all covered the placid surface of the ocean.</p>
<p>Howard was very silent all the morning.&nbsp; He knew now
something very serious had happened, and his surprise was great
at sight of so many useful articles being made way with.&nbsp;
More than once had he been punished for thus disposing of
belaying pins, brooms, swabs and marline-spikes.&nbsp; He trotted
around near the mate, who was an especial favorite of his, and
followed the example of the others by throwing into the sea such
light articles as were suited to his strength.&nbsp; But when <a
name="page225"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 225</span>six bells
struck and the work still continued, he ran to find his
father.&nbsp; Never before could he remember a Sabbath when
services were not in progress at that hour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought this was Sunday, papa?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it is, Howard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t we have church?&nbsp; Have you
preached all the sermons you know?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that, my boy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And shan&rsquo;t we have duff for dessert,
either?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose we shall; we usually do on Sunday and
Wednesday.&nbsp; The reason services are not held to-day is
because there is much work that cannot be delayed. The Lord helps
those who help themselves, and instead of stopping to pray for
deliverance we must first do everything in our power to lessen
the danger.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boy thought a moment, and then ran off to inform his
mother.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mama won&rsquo;t believe it; she&rsquo;ll
think I&rsquo;m fooling her!&rdquo; he called out to his
father.</p>
<p>During the afternoon the boats were watered and provisioned,
and made ready for launching, though Captain Stafford was
determined not to abandon the ship until the last
extremity.&nbsp; It is appalling <a name="page226"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 226</span>to think of leaving a large vessel
in mid-ocean for a few frail cockle-shells, and the master of the
<i>Lochleven</i> entertained a desperate hope that some sort of a
breeze might soon spring up that would at least carry the doomed
ship nearer the Galapagos Islands,&mdash;the only land within a
radius of a thousand miles of the spot where the vessel
lay.&nbsp; A few white wind clouds could be seen on the
south-western horizon, but they rose very slowly.</p>
<p>The fire was evidently gaining very rapidly, for when Mrs.
Stafford went below towards evening she noticed a strong
sulphurous smell pervading the cabin and sleeping rooms.&nbsp;
The captain had not reckoned on this so soon, and took the
precaution to bring his sextant, chronometers, the ship&rsquo;s
papers and some of the charts on deck, where all hands made
arrangements to pass the night; the crew being in the extreme
forward part of the long vessel, the officers amidships, and the
captain&rsquo;s family on the quarter-deck.&nbsp; This in itself
was no especial hardship, for the weather was warm, though not
excessively so.</p>
<p>Magnificent beyond all description was the sunset.&nbsp; The
sky reflected every possible tint&mdash;indigo, light blue, pink,
<a name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>magenta,
light and dark green, yellow, orange, gray and other
hues&mdash;all blended and shaded so harmoniously that it was
impossible to tell where one began and another left off.&nbsp; In
the midst of the indigo blue hung the moon, a crescent of
burnished silver.</p>
<p>As midnight approached, great banks of purple clouds massed
themselves in the heavens, while forked and sheet lightning shot
across the lurid sky.&nbsp; A dozen hands were aloft furling the
skysails and royals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Only a squall, Mary,&rdquo; Captain Stafford said, in
answer to his wife&rsquo;s question, &ldquo;but there is wind
behind it, though perhaps not much.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the early morning hours the first great drops pattered
heavily on the awning, and a puff of wind was perceptible soon
after.&nbsp; Mr. Wells had the deck, and the men joyfully sprang
to the braces to trim the yards in accordance with his
orders.&nbsp; By the time this was accomplished the tropical rain
descended in perfect torrents,&mdash;blinding sheets,&mdash;and
the ship was well heeled over, running before a heavy squall with
nearly squared yards.&nbsp; The rain hissed into the foaming
ocean, the lightning flashed, and for four hours the
<i>Lochleven</i> seemed literally to fly, as if <a
name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 228</span>trying to
escape the demon of destruction within.&nbsp; The awning was new
and shed the torrents of water well, though the heaviness of the
deluge threatened to split it.</p>
<p>The squall passed over slowly, having helped the ship along
nearly fifty miles towards the islands.&nbsp; Then the rain
ceased and the wind nearly so, leaving only a two-knot
zephyr.&nbsp; Even this was better than a calm, but soon after
sunrise it increased to a steady breeze which held all that
day.</p>
<p>The captain and Mrs. Stafford undertook to go below and bring
up some of their clothes and other possessions, but were rendered
nearly insensible before they had crossed the cabin.&nbsp; Up
through the floor came volumes of poisonous gas, rendering the
atmosphere so stifling that both hastened back and stumbled up
the companion-way to the purer air.&nbsp; The books, trinkets and
souvenirs that Mrs. Stafford had picked up all over the
world,&mdash;many of which were rendered dear by their
associations, rather than by their intrinsic value,&mdash;all
these things she prized so highly were utterly lost.&nbsp; The
captain had private charts belonging to himself <a
name="page229"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 229</span>that could
scarcely be replaced.&nbsp; It was impossible to get at them.</p>
<p>All the scuppers were plugged up and water pumped on the main
deck until it fairly swam, There was nothing else to be done but
to scan the horizon and hope that the crisis might not come until
the wind had carried them nearer the islands, which were yet a
good three hundred miles to the eastward.</p>
<p>Another squall from the southwest towards evening increased
their speed, though everyone was in constant fear lest the wind
should fail entirely when it passed over.&nbsp; Captain Stafford
resolved to take to the boats the moment it fell calm, for it was
already perilous to remain on the ship.&nbsp; They were literally
living over a volcano, and nothing but the desire to get as near
land as possible induced him to stick to the vessel so long.</p>
<p>Occasional heavy puffs of smoke and sparks came from two of
the hatches towards morning, and all hands were on the qui vive,
momentarily expecting the order to get the boats over.&nbsp; The
wind grew lighter, and as it failed the poisonous vapors nearly
choked those on board.</p>
<p>The man at the wheel struck eight bells&mdash;it was 4 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>&nbsp; Never again would <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 230</span>those
spokes be clasped by human hands, or that bell be heard to
ring.&nbsp; From away forward floated the answering sound of the
bell on the foremast.</p>
<p>Then came the order &ldquo;Abandon ship!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The ocean was calm, and three of the boats were launched
without difficulty; Captain Stafford, Mr. Maitland and Mr. Wells
each taking charge of one.&nbsp; There was no time to take a last
look, no time for anything but to hurry away from the ship,
before the accumulation of gas in the hold should burst the decks
open or blow the hatches off.</p>
<p>The <i>Lochleven&rsquo;s</i> sails were flapping softly in
obedience to the gentle swell.&nbsp; Her four tall masts with
their great spread of canvas, and imposing three hundred feet of
dark hull, lent a deceptive appearance of security and majestic
strength.&nbsp; She had not been deserted any too soon, for just
as the stars were fading in the east before the swift tropical
dawn, the expected rending of her decks took place.&nbsp; Clouds
of smoke and sheets of flame leaped up, the canvas and rigging
caught, and in an incredibly short space of time, the great
vessel was blazing fiercely.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>The
blowing up of the decks released the imprisoned flames, which
roared and crackled; writhing up the ropes and shrouds to the
very mast heads, as though eager for more material to devour.</p>
<p>Those in the boats watched the awful spectacle with fascinated
eyes.&nbsp; The heat became unbearable, burning brands fell into
the ocean, and a little breeze springing up, they took advantage
of it to get under way.&nbsp; Fanned by the rising wind, that
four thousand tons of burning coal lighted up the ocean for miles
and miles around, while the boats seemed to be floating on a sea
of blood.&nbsp; To their awe-struck occupants, it seemed that the
great beacon must be visible from the Galapagos
Islands,&mdash;the haven which they were destined to reach three
days later.</p>
<p>Suddenly a cry came from Howard.&nbsp; In the hurry and
excitement of departure, Lord Nelson had been left behind!&nbsp;
He begged his father to put back&mdash;implored his mother, with
choking sobs, to let him save his cherished companion.&nbsp; They
tried to comfort him, but in vain.&nbsp; In speechless grief the
boy held out his arms towards the burning ship, gradually melting
into the horizon line; and if Howard Stafford lives to be four
score, he will never shed more bitter or scalding tears than fell
from his eyes at that moment.</p>

</a>Her Majesty&rsquo;s ship <i>Crocodile</i> was anchored in
Plymouth Roads one fine Sunday morning, and a couple of seamen
had obtained shore leave for the afternoon.</p>
<p>Bill and Abraham (called Abe for short) were jolly good
fellows of more than average intelligence, and they determined to
enjoy their day to the utmost.&nbsp; To this end they had refused
to join the mess at dinner, in order that their appetites might
be the keener for the viands at the Royal George, to whose
hospitable doors they directed their steps upon landing.&nbsp;
Both were rigged out in their best togs, and took their seats at
a table with the <a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>pleasant consciousness that their personal appearance
was just about at high water mark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heave us one o&rsquo; them programmes, Sally,&rdquo;
said Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;A mighty trim lass you are, if I does
tell you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Me name is Lucy, your honor,&rdquo; replied the buxom
waitress with a smirk, as she placed a bill-of-fare before the
twain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Married?&rdquo; asked Bill.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, sir.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ve not yet met me fate,&rdquo;
answered Lucy, demurely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Crackey!&nbsp; You must be stage-struck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;&rsquo;Vast there, Bill, and quit your
foolin&rsquo;,&rdquo; interrupted Abe.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m
&rsquo;ungry.&nbsp; Wot will we &rsquo;ave?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was considerably older than his companion, and had reached
that stage in life when not even the charms of a pretty waitress
could make him lose sight of the fact that it was past the time
for dinner.</p>
<p>It seemed to Abe that their orders would never arrive, so he
spent the time in devouring a bottle of little round pickles
which occupied the center of the table. Bill kept trying to
attract the attention of a golden haired fairy who was opening
numerous bottles of ale in another part of the room, and only
desisted when Abe remarked: &ldquo;Seems to me these &rsquo;ere
pickles are awful salty.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>&ldquo;Them ain&rsquo;t pickles, you bloke;
them&rsquo;s holives,&rdquo; said Bill, grinning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wot&rsquo;s that but another name for&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Abe&rsquo;s answer was cut short by the long-expected
appearance of Lucy, and both men were soon doing full justice to
the dinner, which included beefsteak and onions, fried sole with
anchovy sauce, and a pot of stout; besides half a dozen minor
dishes, all of which they relished as only men can who have lived
for some time on ship&rsquo;s stores.</p>
<p>At last Bill said: &ldquo;Well, Abe, ain&rsquo;t you most
done?&nbsp; I&rsquo;m full to the hatches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, sir, your honors &rsquo;asn&rsquo;t &rsquo;ad the
sweets yet,&rdquo; expostulated Lucy.&nbsp; &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got some lovely tarts, and a duff, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Duff!&nbsp; Bring us a whole one, quick!&rdquo; cried
Abe.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve eat too much,&rdquo; said Bill.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I never thought of the duff, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have
eaten all this other truck.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll never be able to
finish a whole one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes we will, too,&rdquo; Abe maintained; so the dainty
was placed before them, and they fell to with a will.&nbsp; But
both soon found that their eyes were larger than their stomachs,
and though Abe ate more than his companion, even he had to stop
<a name="page236"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 236</span>before
more than a third of the duff had been dispatched.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad we &rsquo;ave to leave it,&rdquo; he
said regretfully.</p>
<p>An alarming idea suddenly struck Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;Suppose we
ain&rsquo;t got money enough to pay for all these things
we&rsquo;ve &rsquo;ad,&rdquo; he whispered fearfully.&nbsp; They
asked for their reckoning, and alas! Bill&rsquo;s surmise proved
correct.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we &rsquo;adn&rsquo;t hordered a whole duff,
we&rsquo;d &rsquo;ad money left,&rdquo; said Abe, &ldquo;and now
wot&rsquo;s to be done?&nbsp; We ain&rsquo;t eat a quarter of
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lucy thought of the shilling that Bill had recklessly slipped
into her hand unknown to Abe.&nbsp; After a moment&rsquo;s
consideration, she said confidentially, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave
out the price of the duff, for it&rsquo;s mostly all left, and
very few calls for a whole one.&nbsp; Nobody&rsquo;ll be the
wiser if I brings &rsquo;em a piece of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A load was removed from the minds of the sailors, both of whom
thanked the fair Lucy fervently, and if Bill had had any money
left she would have gotten it. Their table was in a corner near
the entrance, and as they rose to go a commotion in the rear of
the room attracted Lucy&rsquo;s attention.&nbsp; Bill was already
at the <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>door and Abe about to follow, when the tempting duff
again caught his eye.&nbsp; He wavered a minute.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be blowed if I leaves it,&rdquo; he muttered,
as he unbuttoned his loose blouse.</p>
<p>All hands seemed to be gathering in the back of the large
room, and after a stealthy glance to be sure that he was
unobserved, Abe seized the remainder of the duff and placed it in
his bosom.&nbsp; Then he buttoned up his blouse, drew his loose
jacket together as much as possible, and boldly walked out of the
door with head well in the air.</p>
<p>Bill was a little uneasy at first upon hearing what his
companion had done, though he agreed that the duff would be
delicious eating a few hours later.&nbsp; Finally he was rather
glad of Abe&rsquo;s action, and only hoped that Lucy would not
get into a scrape on account of it.</p>
<p>They walked along for some time, until they came to a
church.&nbsp; Many people were entering, and the sound of the
organ announced that services were about to begin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go in, Abe,&rdquo; said Bill.&nbsp;
&ldquo;We looks decent, I guess, and I ain&rsquo;t been in a
bloomin&rsquo; meetin&rsquo;-house since Mag. Halton&rsquo;s
weddin&rsquo;, when I was a youngster.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page238"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
238</span>&ldquo;All right.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll cast anchor in this
&rsquo;ere church for a while.&nbsp; We&rsquo;ll be safer, too,
for I&rsquo;m kind afeerd of the hofficers of the law nabbing us
if we stays on the street.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They passed through the vestibule and into the church; when an
usher took them in tow, and the pair were given seats in the
extreme forward part of the edifice&mdash;in the second row of
pews.&nbsp; Everything seemed strange to Abe and Bill in that dim
half-light, and their eyes had scarcely become accustomed to the
change from out doors when the grand music of the organ again
pealed forth, and the services began with a hymn from the
surpliced choir.</p>
<p>The novelty of the scene wore off after half an hour or so,
and the exercises began to seem a trifle tiresome.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t nothin&rsquo; to&rsquo;t but
singin&rsquo; and then gettin&rsquo; down on your knees, and then
jumpin&rsquo; up and singin&rsquo; again,&rdquo; whispered
Abe.&nbsp; &ldquo;Awful poor singin&rsquo; I calls it, too.&nbsp;
I&rsquo;d like to give &rsquo;em a good chorus
now&mdash;somethin&rsquo; like &lsquo;W&rsquo;isky is the Life of
Man&rsquo;&mdash;just to show &rsquo;em wot real singin&rsquo;
is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say as I admires the parson much,
neither,&rdquo; answered Bill.&nbsp; &ldquo;He looks <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>almighty
severe, he does.&nbsp; I&rsquo;d hate to sign articles with a
craft he was skipper of; he&rsquo;d hang two or three to the fore
yard-arm every morning, just for the fun of the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m agreed on that, Bill.&nbsp; But
look&mdash;the old boy&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; up them
steps.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The minister entered the pulpit; the sermon was about to
begin.</p>
<p>The members of the congregation settled back in their seats
with looks of expectant interest (or resignation) as the reverend
gentleman gave a preparatory cough.&nbsp; After adjusting his
spectacles and calmly surveying his flock, he announced:
&ldquo;Brethren, my discourse this afternoon will be from the
text, &lsquo;Abraham, Abraham, what is in thy
bosom?&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two sailors convulsively grasped the pew cushions as they
exchanged glances of consternation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good G&mdash;, Bill!&rdquo; whispered Abe, &ldquo;the
parson knows I stole that duff!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bill sat as though petrified, and the silence in the house of
worship was such that you could have heard a pin drop.</p>
<p>After giving the congregation a few seconds to digest his
words, the pastor brushed a troublesome fly from his nose, <a
name="page240"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 240</span>and
repeated more slowly and impressively, &ldquo;Abraham, Abraham,
what is in thy bosom?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was too much for Abe, who jumped to his feet exclaiming:
&ldquo;You know I&rsquo;ve got it, parson, so, d&mdash; you, take
it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suiting the action to the word, he hurled the duff at the
astounded minister, and followed by Bill, fled incontinently from
the church.</p>

</a>The full-rigged American ship <i>Sagamore</i> was now
sixty-seven days out from New York bound for San Francisco, and
on this September evening in one of the closing years of the
nineteenth century, she was flying along in the South Atlantic
under a stiff top-gallant breeze, at a rate that no steamer in
that part of the world could eclipse, if, indeed, any could
equal.&nbsp; With the wind a trifle abaft the beam, yards well
off the backstays, and showers of spray whirling over the weather
bulwarks to leeward, the stately ship swept on&mdash;an animated
picture of whose majesty and grace no one may conceive who has <a
name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>not seen a
large square-rigged vessel driving through the water at full
speed.</p>
<p>To the right, scarce fifty miles away, stretched the bleak and
inhospitable coast of Patagonia; to the left, equally distant,
lay the rugged and desolate Falkland Islands; behind, growing
every instant more remote, were civilization and government;
while ahead lay an almost boundless waste of storm-swept waters
frowned upon by grim Cape Horn itself&mdash;firm ruler of a
region which for three centuries has tried the patience of
mariners, and tested the endurance of the stoutest ships that man
can build.</p>
<p>The usual preparation for rounding the Horn had been
made.&nbsp; The old patched-up sails had been taken down, and
strong new ones bent in their places&mdash;for a ship, unlike a
person, wears her best suit of clothes in foul
weather;&mdash;lanyards and standing rigging had been renewed and
strengthened; preventer braces attached to the principal yards;
and life&ndash;lines stretched all over the main deck.</p>
<p>It was the second dog-watch from 6 to 8 <span
class="GutSmall">P.M.</span>&mdash;and a grand but stormy-looking
sunset had given place to the long twilight that prevails in
these high latitudes.&nbsp; A solitary star of great size blazed
<a name="page243"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 243</span>in the
zenith, while on the northern horizon, resembling an immense open
fan, there was a fine display of the Aurora Borealis, which
appeared to rise out of the sea and was becoming more beautiful
as the twilight deepened.</p>
<p>Up on the poop-deck, clad in warm ulsters, the two passengers
were taking their evening constitutional, occasionally pausing to
make some comment on the myriads of Cape pigeons whirling about
the ship, or to watch a lordly albatross swoop down from above
and dive beneath the waters&mdash;seldom failing to seize the
hapless fish that his unerring eye had spied from afar.&nbsp;
Both were young fellows of perhaps twenty-five, who in this long
voyage had sought rest; the one from college studies too closely
pursued, and the other from the countless worries and nervous
tension of American business life.</p>
<p>Will Hartley and Frank Wilbur had never met until the day
before leaving New York, and as both were of rather reserved
dispositions, their relations at first were those of
acquaintances rather than friends.&nbsp; But all that was now
changed, for gradually they began to thoroughly like each other;
and by this time were nearly inseparable.&nbsp; Several
months&rsquo; daily <a name="page244"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 244</span>intercourse between two young men
shut up in a ship together is a severe test of companionship, but
in the present case it had resulted most happily.</p>
<p>Hartley broke a short silence by saying; &ldquo;To think that
ten weeks have passed since I saw a newspaper!&nbsp; All sorts of
events have happened on shore that no one here dreams
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do we care?&rdquo; answered Wilbur, with a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;We are in a world of our own, and as for me,
I don&rsquo;t bother about what is going on in the United
States.&nbsp; It seems as if I had always lived on this ship, and
my whole past life appears a vague dream.&nbsp; What I would like
to know is, whether the <i>Arabia</i> and <i>Iroquois</i> are
ahead of us or not.&nbsp; It will be too bad if they beat us to
San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No danger of that if we keep up this rate of
speed.&nbsp; George! but we&rsquo;re traveling.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s
take a look at the log.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Captain Meade, a fine-looking man of fifty, joined the
passengers, remarking as he rubbed his hands in a satisfied
fashion, &ldquo;Well, gentlemen, this is a good start around the
Horn.&nbsp; We were 50&deg; 45&rsquo; south this noon, and if
this wind would only draw into the north a trifle and then hold,
we might be across 50 in the Pacific a <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>week from
to-day.&nbsp; I made it in six days once, but never expect to
again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a seaman speaks of rounding Cape Horn he does not mean
simply passing the Cape itself, as one might Cape Cod or Cape
Flattery.&nbsp; Looking at a map of South America, we find that
the Horn is situated in 56&deg; south latitude; but from the
moment a ship crosses the fiftieth parallel in the South Atlantic
until she has passed down around the stormy Cape and up in the
Pacific to the fiftieth parallel in that ocean,&mdash;a distance
approaching a thousand miles, she is said to be &ldquo;rounding
Cape Horn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Until she is across 50 in the Pacific,
the vessel is never safe from being blown clear back to the Cape
by the furious western gales and hurricanes that rage almost
continuously in this region.&nbsp; Thus the <i>Sagamore</i> had
already started to round the Horn, although she was yet several
hundred miles from the place itself.</p>
<p>The wind had increased to nearly a gale, and the ship was
beginning to take some good-sized seas on board.&nbsp; The big
surges struck the vessel&rsquo;s sides with a shock that made her
tremble as she sped on, and the mate soon bawled out, &ldquo;Clew
up the mizzen to&rsquo;-gallant s&rsquo;il!&rdquo;&nbsp; The work
<a name="page246"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 246</span>of
stripping the ship continued until nothing remained but a few
storm-sails.&nbsp; All hands had been called, and it was indeed a
sight to see the men aloft on the yards in the gathering
darkness, as they tugged at the flapping canvas, trying to lay it
on the yard so as to pass the gaskets round; while the wind
howled through the rigging like mad, and the <i>Sagamore</i>, as
she plunged on, began to roll at a lively rate under the
influence of the big sea which was being kicked up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad I&rsquo;m not a sailor,&rdquo; said
Wilbur, preparing to go below.&nbsp; Just then a comber broke
against the stern, and a good-sized lump of water plumped down on
his back, drenching him thoroughly.&nbsp; Hartley laughed; so did
the bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un, who passed at that moment, and the
passengers quickly descended the companion-way to the cabin,
whose warmth and security were in sharp contrast to the bellowing
gale and streaming decks without.</p>
<p>An exquisitely wrought lamp of Benares brass&mdash;it had once
graced a viceroy&rsquo;s mansion in Calcutta&mdash;shed its soft
light on the marble-topped center table.&nbsp; The
captain&rsquo;s compass affixed to the ceiling silently indicated
the vessel&rsquo;s course, and a number of fine geraniums which
<a name="page247"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
247</span>ornamented the wheel-house windows in warm weather now
occupied a rack about the inside of the skylight.&nbsp; The ends
of the room were occupied by two cozy sofas, with lockers
underneath; one containing old copies of
&ldquo;Harper&rsquo;s&rdquo; and &ldquo;Scribner&rsquo;s,&rdquo;
while a liberal supply of ale, beer, and similar comforts filled
the other.&nbsp; Upon the walls, handsomely finished in panels of
natural woods, were a brace of revolvers and several glittering
swords and cutlasses belonging to the captain,&mdash;excellent
weapons to have on a ship far removed from all civil law for
months at a time.&nbsp; The floor was of Oregon pine, beautifully
oiled and polished.&nbsp; Contrary to custom, it was on this
voyage covered by a carpet that the steward had put down soon
after leaving port, &ldquo;so as the passengers wouldn&rsquo;t
break their necks when she got to rolling off Cape
Horn.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nearly all the way from New York to the
Falklands the weather had been glorious, and the ship stood up
like a church in the few squalls that were encountered; but now
the young men began to think the steward had known what he was
about when that carpet was laid.&nbsp; Walking or even sitting
still had become an accomplishment, so Hartley brought out the
fifth volume of &ldquo;Les Miserables,&rdquo; <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>while
Wilbur produced one of the numerous books he had provided.&nbsp;
With chair-backs to the table, and feet braced against the sofas,
they defied the elements temporarily and read on&mdash;to the
accompaniment of groaning timbers, an occasional crash from the
steward&rsquo;s pantry, and the muffled roaring of the gale
without.</p>
<p>The storm gained strength as the night advanced.&nbsp; While
the mizzen topsail was being furled, bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un Merrell
went forward under the forecastle deck to put additional lashings
on several casks of provisions stowed in the vicinity.&nbsp; He
was assisted by two foremast hands, and the trio had just secured
a barrel of flour when the ship was struck by a heavy sea, and
gave a vicious roll that threw all three men against a water-butt
standing near.&nbsp; The sailors gained their feet uninjured, but
before the stunned bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un could recover himself, a
half-filled cask of beef broke loose and was hurled through space
as though shot from a cannon.&nbsp; With a cry of warning, the
two seamen stumbled out of the way, but before Merrell could
escape he was felled like an ox, and his lantern smashed to
fragments.&nbsp; The motion in that extreme forward part of the
ship was very great, and the cask soon took <a
name="page249"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 249</span>another
dive in a different direction; when the men, guided by the groans
of the injured bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un, groped their way to where he
lay and contrived to drag him behind the hatch-coaming.&nbsp; He
was able to sit up, and gasped out &ldquo;Call the mate, Jack;
I&rsquo;ve got a bad hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was about two o&rsquo;clock in the morning.&nbsp; Captain
Meade had been on deck most of the night, and went forward upon
hearing of the accident.&nbsp; The suffering man was borne into
his little room near the galley, where he underwent an
examination which resulted in the discovery that the left leg was
broken midway between knee and ankle.</p>
<p>Few men have commanded deep-water ships for twenty years
without having had to deal with broken limbs occasionally, and
the master of the <i>Sagamore</i> was no exception.&nbsp; Twice
before had he successfully met a similar emergency, and in the
present case there was a valuable assistant at hand in the person
of Mr. Hartley, who had just completed a course of study at a New
York medical college, and was now en route to the Pacific Coast
to practice.</p>
<p>Having made his way aft across the dark and steeply-inclined
deck, the captain called the steward, and then apprised <a
name="page250"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 250</span>Hartley of
what had occurred.&nbsp; That young man had not slept for some
hours, and upon learning of the accident was most anxious to
render all the assistance in his power; for the
bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un was a good-natured fellow, liked by all.</p>
<p>While Hartley struggled into his clothes, Captain Meade
procured splints and bandages from the medicine-chest.&nbsp; When
both were ready, they opened the storm-door leading onto the main
deck, and awaited a favorable moment.&nbsp; The night was black,
but the gloom was relieved somewhat by the foam-covered water
surging about the deck.&nbsp; Holding to the life-lines with one
hand, they dashed forward along the lee side, stopping once to
seize the line tightly and haul themselves up off the deck to
avoid a deluge that tumbled over the weather bulwarks, and poured
down to leeward.</p>
<p>The steward was already in attendance on the patient, and
Hartley at once set about uniting the broken bones and applying
the splints.&nbsp; What Captain Meade would have considered a
painful and disagreeable necessity, he regarded from a
professional standpoint only, and went about his work with a
coolness and assurance that greatly relieved both captain and <a
name="page251"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
251</span>patient.&nbsp; The abominable rolling was the worst
obstacle to be overcome, but the task was at last accomplished,
and in a highly creditable manner.</p>
<p>Merrell was resting easier when Captain Meade and &ldquo;the
surgeon&rdquo; proceeded aft.&nbsp; The former stretched the
chart of the Cape Horn region upon the cabin table and examined
it long and closely; for Staten Land&mdash;rocky, uninhabited,
and with no lighthouse to reveal its position&mdash;was rapidly
being neared, and great caution was necessary.</p>
<p>There was now an apparent lull in the gale, but it was not for
long.&nbsp; At daylight the <i>Sagamore</i> entered a
&ldquo;tide-rip&rdquo; whose waters, lashed into fury by the
gale, presented an awful spectacle.&nbsp; The ocean resembled a
gigantic mill-race; the tide flowing one way, while a swift
current set in the opposite direction, forming a whirlpool.&nbsp;
Huge waves came from all directions at once, pouring tons of
water on the main deck and forecastle.&nbsp; Progress was
well-nigh impossible, but the captain kept resolutely on, knowing
that the ship&rsquo;s only salvation lay in running through the
tide-rip before she should be hurled upon her side by some sea
more mountainous than the rest.&nbsp; This nearly happened once
when <a name="page252"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 252</span>a
towering wave half as high as the fore yard broke on board,
staving in the heavy door of the galley and flooding the
interior, washing everything movable from the decks; while the
ship went over, and over, and over, till her yard-arms almost
touched the water, and her decks were like the sloping roof of a
house.</p>
<p>But the crisis was safely passed, and the maelstrom left
behind.&nbsp; The gale blew itself out during the forenoon, the
sky cleared, the sun shone brightly through the clear frosty
atmosphere, and land was visible from the deck.</p>
<p>Land!</p>
<p>If you have never been so situated that for many weeks your
eyes have not beheld a solitary foot of ground you can hardly
appreciate the emotions of all on board the <i>Sagamore</i> as
they looked on that bleak and forbidding promontory rising out of
the mist&mdash;Cape St. John.&nbsp; A few hours later, the ship
was opposite the treacherous straits of Lemaire, and very near
the shore.&nbsp; The entire length of Staten Land from Cape St.
John on the east to Cape St. Bartholomew on the west, was
stretched out like a grand panorama; forty miles of low
mountains, jagged rocks, and broken valleys, without a sign of
animal <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>or vegetable life, and with naught save great patches
of snow to relieve its black nakedness.&nbsp; The straits of
Lemaire separate this body of land from Tierra del Fuego, and on
the latter might now be seen Bell Mountain,&mdash;a distant but
lofty peak, on whose snow-capped summit the sun shone in wintry
splendor.</p>
<p>Hundreds of large sailing vessels pass Cape St. John every
year on their long voyages from New York, the British Isles and
Continental Europe to our Pacific coast.&nbsp; It is a great
rendezvous, and the <i>Sagamore</i> presently found herself in
the midst of an imposing fleet of merchantmen of all
nations.&nbsp; Here, at the southern extremity of the American
continent, were ten ships and three barks, carrying the
world&rsquo;s products to San Francisco.&nbsp; Scores of eager
faces lined the bulwarks, while on the poop of the nearest craft
stood a woman&mdash;the first representative of the fair sex that
anyone on the <i>Sagamore</i> had seen for three months.&nbsp; As
the large vessels, with all their canvas set, slowly mounted the
regular swell, a murmur of admiration burst from the passengers,
who longed for a far-reaching camera to preserve the beautiful
picture through years to come.&nbsp; Those ships had completed
the <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>first half of their long journeys, and now sailed in
company for a few hours, soon to be scattered far and wide upon
the mighty Pacific, to meet again at the Golden Gate, thousands
of miles away.&nbsp; It was a sight to make the pulses
thrill.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> II.</h3>
<p>&ldquo;Come on deck if you want to see Cape Horn!&rdquo;
called out Captain Meade to the passengers in the cabin, who
instantly hurried on deck, for one can&rsquo;t see the famous
Cape every day.</p>
<p>The captain silently pointed his finger, and there, looming up
out of the morning mist, the passengers saw Cape Horn.&nbsp; It
was nearly twenty miles off, but so deceptive are distances at
sea that it seemed not half that distance away.&nbsp; Who can
behold without a feeling of awe, that black and naked rock,
rising precipitously from a low islet to a height of five hundred
feet!&nbsp; Like some grim and frowning sentinel, it stands guard
where the waters of the two great oceans meet; tyrannizing over
and sorely harassing the staunch ships which even its power is
rarely able to destroy; drawing on, but to beat roughly back; and
occasionally permitting one of them to fly past without even a
protest, as if to <a name="page255"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
255</span>say, &ldquo;I can be gracious when the mood&rsquo;s
upon me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a sharp, bracing morning.&nbsp; Everything wore a
peaceful aspect, in spite of the peculiar moaning and whistling
sound in the rigging which is always heard here.&nbsp; To the
south, a vast ice-floe glittered in the brilliant sunlight; to
leeward, two thin columns of smoke-like mist rising from the
water showed where a couple of whales were blowing; while much
nearer the ship, five splendid albatross sat gracefully upon the
heavy swell&mdash;their black wings in striking contrast to their
snow-white backs and necks.&nbsp; This grand looking creature is
to the birds of the ocean what the eagle is to the birds of the
land, and the martial look in its piercing black eye suggests a
prince in disguise from some fairy tale.</p>
<p>The cabin breakfast had just been concluded, and the Cape
pigeons were swarming around the ship, or swimming in the water
alongside.&nbsp; The cunning horde knew the hours meals were
served as well as they did day from night, and at such times all
were on hand, waiting for the scraps which they knew would be
thrown overboard by the cook and steward.&nbsp; They are pretty
creatures, uniting the eyes and <a name="page256"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 256</span>feet of a duck with the head, bill,
and other characteristics of the domestic pigeon.&nbsp; The
breast is white, the head and back a bluish black, while the
wings are dappled black and white.&nbsp; Beneath the feathers,
the bird is covered with a wonderfully thick, soft down, which is
so dense that not a drop of the icy water in which the creatures
delight to swim and dive, can ever penetrate to the skin.&nbsp;
Soon after a ship has passed the latitude of Rio de Janeiro, the
pigeons begin to make their appearance, and they follow that
vessel for weeks and weeks, until she has passed around the Horn,
and far up into the Pacific.&nbsp; Then they disappear gradually
as the warm latitudes are reached, transferring their allegiance
to some craft bound back in the opposite direction.&nbsp; How
they obtain sleep and rest is a mystery, for one never lights on
a ship; but no matter how fast a vessel may go, or how severe a
gale may rage, the whole tribe is in attendance every morning,
like an army following its general.</p>
<p>The cook threw overboard a quantity of table scraps, and
instantly every pigeon flew to the spot; all keeping up a
discordant scolding and chattering, as each tried to keep the
others from getting a bite, at <a name="page257"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 257</span>the same time gulping down anything
it could get hold of.&nbsp; Several dived far down after sinking
morsels.&nbsp; The passengers deciding to catch some of the
birds, a line, with a small baited hook, was trailed out astern,
and seven pigeons were soon hauled aboard, being caught in the
mouth precisely as a fish is.</p>
<p>The first thing any ocean bird does upon being put on the deck
of a ship, is to become sea-sick; and the prisoners unanimously
followed this program.&nbsp; After parting with their breakfasts,
they felt better, and one could not help laughing at the
ludicrous expression of astonishment in the creatures&rsquo; eyes
as they surveyed their novel surroundings.&nbsp; In the air or in
the water, they were the personification of grace; but now they
seemed to be all legs, and fell down, or plumped into something,
after waddling a few yards.&nbsp; Then they ran along flapping
their wings, as they tried to get sufficient start to enable them
to soar, but only one succeeded in clearing the bulwarks.&nbsp;
An old necktie was torn into strips, one being fastened around
the neck of each bird.&nbsp; Thus ornamented, the captives were
tossed up into the air, and off they went to tell their
companions amongst what strange barbarians they had fallen.</p>
<p><a name="page258"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 258</span>The
barometer had been falling for some days, and in spite of the
fine morning, there were strong indications of an equinoctial
hurricane.&nbsp; A heavy snowstorm hid Cape Horn from view that
afternoon, a contrary wind sprang up, and the ship was driven
entirely off her course, being compelled to head for the South
Pole.&nbsp; The passengers arrayed themselves in oilers, not
forgetting to tie strands of rope about their boot-tops to keep
the water out, and paced the quarter-deck, where George Marsh,
the mate, entertained them with tales of torrid Singapore.</p>
<p>But spray was flying over the <i>Sagamore</i>, the
gale&rsquo;s roaring made conversation difficult, and though the
speed was exhilarating, the young men were soon driven below,
leaving the mate to his lonely vigil.</p>
<p>He paced the deck with no companion but his own gloomy and
bitter thoughts, for his life had been a hard one.&nbsp; Confined
to a seamen&rsquo;s hospital for many weary months by a terrible
accident, he had thus lost command of a fine bark; and when at
last he left the sick room, it was only to receive the crushing
intelligence that all his earthly possessions had been destroyed
by fire.&nbsp; Though a splendid seaman, he <a
name="page259"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 259</span>had since
been unable to obtain a master&rsquo;s berth, and now as a
subordinate, trod the deck of a ship which he was in every way
fitted to command.</p>
<p>By midnight the ship was rolling so frightfully that it was
feared some of the masts would go.&nbsp; Great seas were coming
aboard, the main deck resembled a lake, and the crew had
hair-breadth escapes from going overboard.&nbsp; The bellowing of
the hurricane was awful, and a constant succession of
snow-squalls struck the ship, sending the white flakes driving
through the air and upon the decks in a feathery cloud.&nbsp; The
carpenter was proceeding to the pumps to sound the well when he
fell upon the slippery deck, fetching up in the lee scuppers a
moment later, where he was buried in foam and water.&nbsp; He had
presence of mind enough to grasp a rope, and when the ship rolled
in the opposite direction he emerged from his unceremonious bath
as though nothing had happened.&nbsp; The hurricane continued to
gather force; the decks were swept of everything movable, and the
possible shifting of the cargo caused continual
apprehension.&nbsp; But a more serious danger threatened the
ship.&nbsp; When the temperature of the water was taken, the
thermometer registered a sharp <a name="page260"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 260</span>drop, indicating the proximity of a
large body of ice.&nbsp; A sharp lookout was kept, but the
blackness of the night and the fury of the hurricane made it
impossible to see any distance from the ship.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Just before daybreak, the thrilling cry of &ldquo;Ice dead
ahead!&rdquo; came from the lookout, and there was hardly time to
give the wheel a few turns before a great gray mass loomed up on
the port bow.&nbsp; A moment more, and one of the gigantic ice
mountains so dreaded in these southern seas came into plain
view.&nbsp; It towered far above the mast-heads, culminating in a
circle of fantastic pinnacles which resembled the turrets of a
castle.&nbsp; The waves, breaking against its base with a noise
like thunder, hurled themselves far up its steep sides, soon to
descend in the form of foaming cataracts and water falls.&nbsp;
High up on the near side, overhanging the water, was a
threatening mass of ice that seemed ready to fall on the ship,
and blot her out of existence.&nbsp; So perilously close to the
great berg was the <i>Sagamore</i>, that its freezing breath
chilled all on deck to the marrow, and the ship&rsquo;s red port
light, as she swept by, shone weirdly on the frozen mass,
revealing gruesome caverns that penetrated far inward.&nbsp;
Everyone breathed <a name="page261"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
261</span>easier when the monster was passed, and several
recalled the names of missing ships that mysteriously disappeared
in the South Atlantic.</p>
<p>The first streaks of dawn revealed five more bergs, which
formed an icy barrier through which it was perilous to attempt a
passage; while the dangerous group of rocks known as the Diego
Ramirez effectually blocked the way to the north.&nbsp; At any
moment the flying ship might crash into one of the bergs, so it
was decided to heave to, thus lessening the danger of
collision.</p>
<p>Tacking a large square-rigged vessel is considerable of a job
at any time, but at night, and in a hurricane, it is an arduous
task.&nbsp; The stiffened braces, wet with icy salt water, got
tangled up, and occasionally a man would make a mistake amid the
maze of ropes, thus adding to the confusion.&nbsp; But at last
the work was finished, and the ship brought to a
standstill.&nbsp; Several times she went over so far that captain
and mates hardly dared to breathe for fear she was on her side
and would never right.&nbsp; But after remaining in that
precarious position for a moment, the ship would keel over with a
sickening velocity from one side to the other; the mast-heads <a
name="page262"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 262</span>reeling
dizzily against the sky, until she brought up with a jerk, as a
sea pounded against her side.&nbsp; At each roll, the bulwarks
went far under, allowing a flood to come roaring and tumbling
aboard; washing about the main deck, tangling up ropes, and
knocking men off their feet.&nbsp; Several seamen were kept busy
attending to the oil-bags, whose contents were poured upon the
waters in large quantities, but without the usual effect.&nbsp;
The exposed position of the forward house subjected it to the
full fury of the hurricane.&nbsp; The helpless
bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un lay in his bunk listening to the roaring and
screeching outside, and once when an unusually big sea descended
on the roof overhead, making the oak beams crack ominously, he
set his teeth and thought of the calamity that had recently
befallen an American ship, when the whole forward house with its
sleeping inmates was carried overboard, and half the ship&rsquo;s
company annihilated at one fell blow.</p>
<p>Pandemonium reigned in the cabin.&nbsp; A sea stove in the
companion door, the water pouring down stairs and flooding
everything.&nbsp; Several pieces of furniture broke loose, and
were banged against the partitions half the night.&nbsp;
Everything was upside down; oatmeal covered the floor <a
name="page263"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 263</span>of the
steward&rsquo;s pantry, and the bathroom was littered with broken
glass.&nbsp; Both passengers were thankful when daylight
dispelled the most anxious night either had ever passed.</p>
<p>For a long time, the steward could not get forward, nor was
the cook able to get aft.&nbsp; Consequently, there was no cabin
breakfast until nearly nine o&rsquo;clock.&nbsp; Such a
meal!&nbsp; It was eaten by lamplight, for great seas were
thundering down on the poop overhead and the storm shutters to
the windows could not be taken off.&nbsp; It had been found
almost impossible to keep anything on the galley stove, but the
cook and steward between them managed to prepare some coffee,
biscuits, ham and potatoes.&nbsp; The biscuits were lost when the
steward fell on the deck as he conveyed the breakfast aft, but
those who gathered about the table were satisfied, as they had
their hands too full to eat anything at all, and Wilbur kept
thinking of the line, &ldquo;Some ha&rsquo; meat, and canna
eat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>All that day and night the hurricane lasted.&nbsp; The
following afternoon, the barometer, after falling for a week,
came to a stand at 28:20, and the climax had been reached.</p>
<p><a name="page264"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
264</span>&ldquo;I thought I had seen storms before,&rdquo; said
Wilbur, &ldquo;but this equinoctial has opened my eyes.&nbsp; It
passes my comprehension how any ship can stand such a pounding
and wrenching as this one has endured for three days and
nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have both been wishing for a genuine hurricane ever
since leaving New York, and now that wish has been
gratified,&rdquo; replied the captain.&nbsp; &ldquo;In my
twenty-six voyages around the Horn I have never seen such
weather, though some ships catch it even worse; but with the
<i>Sagamore</i> under my feet, and plenty of sea-room, I fear
nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The captain turned in early that night, for his clothes had
not been removed for seventy-two hours past, during which trying
interval he had had no rest but a few short naps.&nbsp; The
passengers were thinking of retiring also, when they heard a call
from the steward, who requested them to come into the dining room
a moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want to show you a fine sight,&rdquo; said he,
standing by the door leading onto the main deck, which he
cautiously opened part way as Hartley and Wilbur approached.</p>
<p>The hurricane had spent its force, and the young men looked
out upon a night <a name="page265"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
265</span>scene of rare beauty.&nbsp; Every cloud in the sky had
vanished as if by magic, and the blue vault of the firmament was
brilliant with countless myriads of stars.&nbsp; Some were large,
some small; and to the admiring gaze of the watchers it seemed as
if they had never seen so grand a sight, even in the Southern
Hemisphere, where the numerous planets, constellations, and
single stars illumine the night sky with a splendor surpassing
anything of the kind to be seen in the North.&nbsp; But among all
those stars, and groups of stars, none could compare with that
blazing constellation that had now nearly reached the
zenith&mdash;the Southern Cross.&nbsp; It is first seen just
before crossing the equator, but is then dim and very low in the
horizon, and visible but a short time each evening.&nbsp;
Gradually, as Cape Horn is approached, it rises higher and
higher, its appearance each night being foretold by its two
flashing &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; stars, which, like heralds
announcing the coming of their sovereign, are visible above the
horizon a short time before the Cross itself appears.&nbsp; In
the vicinity of the Horn this matchless constellation may be seen
high in the heavens, in all its glory&mdash;the stars composing
it not larger than several others in the sky, but as completely
<a name="page266"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
266</span>eclipsing them in brilliancy as diamonds do pieces of
glass.&nbsp; Now, after three days and nights of warring winds
and waters, that Cross looked down upon the
<i>Sagamore&rsquo;s</i> naked masts and flooded decks like an
emblem of promise and of peace.&nbsp; Not a great way off were
the two curious patches of luminous film known as the Magellan
Clouds, looking strange and mysterious as they floated among that
sea of stars.</p>
<p>The foam-covered water washed about the deck as the ship
rolled, and a heavy sea tumbling aboard caused the steward to
close the door in a hurry.&nbsp; Then the passengers took a
gin-fizz as a night-cap, and turned in.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> III.</h3>
<p>Becalmed off Cape Horn!</p>
<p>This may sound paradoxical, but calms do occur, though they
are not common.&nbsp; But for indescribable grandeur, and as a
manifestation of the powers of nature, there are few things that
will compare with a calm in this region.</p>
<p>One degree south of the Horn, on the 57th parallel, there is
no land around the whole earth&rsquo;s surface&mdash;not even an
island; and this is the primary reason why the largest waves to
be found anywhere are <a name="page267"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 267</span>met with in this locality.&nbsp;
Here, unchecked and unconfined, they sweep entirely around the
globe; gathering strength and size as they move on, with nothing
to bar their resistless march or to make them swerve aside even a
hair&rsquo;s breadth.&nbsp; Lashed into fury by a gale, these
waves are sufficiently remarkable, but they are then in such a
state of turmoil as to destroy all regularity, making it
impossible to tell where one begins and another ends.&nbsp; So,
strangely enough, it is in a dead calm that one is more nearly
able to conceive of their vast proportions.&nbsp; These periods
generally follow a hard westerly gale, and then it is a sight no
words can depict, to stand upon a vessel&rsquo;s deck and watch
the approach of those vast walls of water; each one sharply
defined, and wonderfully regular in form.&nbsp; From the base of
one to the base of the next following is frequently a space of
one thousand feet&mdash;a great valley, which, contrasted with
the long hills on either side, gives one some idea of the
magnitude of these waves.</p>
<p>Such a condition of things prevailed on the day after the
equinoctial hurricane.&nbsp; The <i>Sagamore</i> had not even
steerage way, and lay broadside on to the heavy swell, rolling as
only a vessel can roll in a <a name="page268"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 268</span>Cape Horn calm.&nbsp; The great blue
hills came on slowly but regularly; and each one, as it came
beneath the ship, lifted her up on its crest as though she had
been a feather, instead of a vessel three hundred feet long,
drawing twenty-six feet of water, and with four thousand tons of
railroad iron and other heavy stuff in her hold.&nbsp; Then, as
it passed on, there was a rattling of blocks and the heavy
reports of canvas banged against the rigging, as the
<i>Sagamore</i> slid down the side of the hill with her decks at
an angle of fifty degrees.</p>
<p>She had the usual nondescript crew found on deep-water ships,
and after hearing some of them talk, one might well agree with
Mr. Marsh &ldquo;That the captain or mate who goes to sea
now-a-days, should understand Chinese, Greek, Hindostanee,
Russian-Finn, and a dozen other tongues, besides having the
patience of Job.&rdquo;&nbsp; It being Sunday, no one was
required to do any work but what was necessary in navigating the
ship, and the men improved their leisure time in various
ways.&nbsp; A few spruced up a bit; among them, Gene, the
Frenchman, who was far above the rest in intelligence and
ability.&nbsp; After arraying himself in a scarlet woolen shirt,
new trousers and shoes, he lay down in his <a
name="page269"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 269</span>bunk to
read, unmindful of the turmoil about him.&nbsp; Several produced
sewing materials and mended their clothes, keeping time with
their feet while an agile young fellow danced; others sang coarse
songs, or told stories.&nbsp; Jack, a tow-headed Scandinavian,
devoured &ldquo;Demon Dick, the Dare-devil.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had
purchased a number of these hair-raising effusions, and read them
in preference to the tracts and pious books furnished by the
Sailors&rsquo; Aid Society, only one of which had been opened,
and that was being used up for cigarette papers.&nbsp; Some
played gambling games, using plugs of tobacco for stakes, while
Jumbo, the smallest man on board (formerly a trapeze performer),
gave an exhibition on a tight rope which won applause.&nbsp; One
group discussed the subject of provisions, and though all agreed
that the &ldquo;grub&rdquo; on the <i>Sagamore</i> was
satisfactory, some found great fault with the cookery.&nbsp; Then
they abused the mates, decided that Captain Meade was afraid to
carry sail enough, and speculated as to how much Hartley and
Wilbur were worth&mdash;for whenever there are passengers on
merchant ships the crew seem to consider them millionaires.</p>
<p><a name="page270"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 270</span>But
the great &ldquo;character&rdquo; in the forecastle was
Andrew,&mdash;usually called San Quentin, from the fact of his
having &ldquo;done time&rdquo; in the California penitentiary of
that name.&nbsp; He was a hoary-headed old sinner, whose
three-score odd years would have rendered him of little account
before the mast had he not belonged to that past age when
merchant sailors had to know their business, and were able seamen
in something besides name.&nbsp; Andrew was a voluble talker, and
frequently related with gusto how he had once
&ldquo;knifed&rdquo; a fellow sailor who had roused his ire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A man ought to die when he gets to be fifty,&rdquo; he
remarked, rubbing a rheumatic joint.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Better jump overboard, then,&rdquo; answered a
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m gettin&rsquo; too old for this work,&rdquo;
Andrew continued, &ldquo;and if the cap&rsquo;n says a good word
for me, I&rsquo;ll try and get in the Sailors&rsquo; Snug Harbor
when we comes back to New York.&nbsp; Sure, I&rsquo;ve been
goin&rsquo; to sea forty-six year, and I&rsquo;m no better off
now nor I was when I began.&nbsp; They teached me tailorin&rsquo;
when I was in the pen, but I&rsquo;d ship on twenty more voyages
afore I&rsquo;d shut myself up in a little shop on shore where
they ain&rsquo;t room to breathe.&nbsp; <a
name="page271"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 271</span>But
I&rsquo;m a lucky old cuss&rdquo; (with a laugh), &ldquo;for I
ain&rsquo;t never been wrecked in all my time at sea,&mdash;no,
nor ever seed a wreck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Andrew&rsquo;s going to turn into a tough old albatross
when he slips his cable,&rdquo; put in Gene, a smile on his
clear-cut features.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be careful ye don&rsquo;t turn into a molly-hawk
yourself, ye French devil,&rdquo; retorted San Quentin, hurling
his sheath-knife in the air, and dexterously catching the
descending point on the tip of his little finger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tumble out, mates,&rdquo; called a sailor, poking his
head through the door.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo;
up.&nbsp; All hands aft is squintin&rsquo; through the glass at
what the matey says is a boat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This news brought everyone out on deck in a hurry.&nbsp; Quite
a distance from the ship, a small object floated on the
swell,&mdash;now lifted high on a sea, then disappearing from
view in the trough.&nbsp; The officers had been examining it
through the telescope for some time, Mr. Marsh finally declaring
it to be a boat.&nbsp; The sight of a solitary boat in such a
place gave rise to much speculation, and when the calm was
replaced by a gentle breeze, the course was changed so as to
bring the waif alongside.</p>
<p><a name="page272"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
272</span>Within an hour the tiny craft was close by, and a
melancholy spectacle she presented.&nbsp; Bottom upward, with
jagged splinters projecting from her shattered sides, she floated
by on the sportive waves&mdash;an eloquent symbol of recent
disaster. How had she come there?&nbsp; Where were her late
occupants?&nbsp; None could tell but old ocean, glittering in the
frosty sunshine.&nbsp; Upon her stern were the words
&ldquo;Dundee, of Liverpool.&rdquo;&nbsp; The captain was about
to go below in order to look up the <i>Dundee</i> in the shipping
register, when a sailor hailed the deck from aloft.&nbsp; A
vessel was visible far to the south!</p>
<p>The mate ascended the rigging, followed by the passengers; and
sure enough, the naked eye beheld a shadowy ship on the horizon
which the glass magnified into a wreck.&nbsp; All was excitement;
the course was again changed, and the ship bore down for the
distant vessel.&nbsp; She was nearly twenty miles away; the
breeze was provokingly light, and it seemed an age before the
<i>Sagamore</i> drew near the stranger.</p>
<p>Distress signals were flying from her foremast&mdash;the only
spar left standing.&nbsp; The others hung over the side, their
weight helping to careen the vessel at a <a
name="page273"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 273</span>dangerous
angle, besides pounding against her like battering-rams every
time she rolled.&nbsp; Six men could be seen, one of whom stood
apart waving a flag, while most of the others ran about in the
most frantic transports; now falling upon their knees, then
rising and extending their arms toward the <i>Sagamore</i>.&nbsp;
The wreck was apparently full of water, so there was no time to
be lost.</p>
<p>Nothing short of a case like this could have induced Captain
Meade to launch a boat off Cape Horn, for the huge waves and the
liability to sudden squalls make it a perilous proceeding at all
times.&nbsp; Mr. Marsh took command of the gig with a carefully
selected crew, but it required half an hours&rsquo; maneuvering
to launch her.&nbsp; At length a successful start was made, and
the gig went racing up the side of a big sea, was poised giddily
on its crest, and then darted down the incline as though bound
for the bottom.&nbsp; On she went, her crew rowing like demons,
while two men bailed out the water that constantly threatened to
swamp her.</p>
<p>As the rescuers neared the sinking vessel, the mate bawled
&ldquo;Wreck ahoy! what bark is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page274"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
274</span>&ldquo;The Dundee, of Liverpool, bound from Buenos
Ayres to Valparaiso.&nbsp; We are foundering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are the American ship <i>Sagamore</i>, from New York
for San Francisco.&nbsp; Heave us a rope and we&rsquo;re ready
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gig was now on the lee side of the bark, and as near the
stern as prudence would allow; so the men rested on their oars
while Mr. Marsh deftly caught the rope flung from the wreck by
her captain.&nbsp; In order to enter the boat it was necessary
for those on the <i>Dundee</i> to slide down the rope, and then
be hauled aboard when the end was reached.&nbsp; The steward and
three seamen constituted the first load; descending in safety,
one by one, though most of them were submerged twice before they
were at length pulled into the boat.&nbsp; Two seamen, an
apprentice and the captain remained on the wreck, the latter
declaring his intention of standing by his craft to the last,
though he well knew she was about to take the final plunge.&nbsp;
Already that uncanny moaning sound heard only on a foundering
vessel was ascending from the black depths of the hold, as the
rising waters forced out the sustaining air through every
crevice.</p>
<p><a name="page275"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 275</span>It
was a hard pull back to the <i>Sagamore</i>,&mdash;against the
wind all the way,&mdash;and while the mate steered the
heavily-laden gig, the steward narrated the story of the
catastrophe.&nbsp; The <i>Dundee</i>, commanded by Captain
Murray, had sailed from Buenos Ayres without a cargo, taking
aboard for ballast eight hundred tons of dirt scooped from the
river bottom; and to this improper ballast the disaster was
due.&nbsp; She labored heavily during the first day of the
hurricane, and sprang a leak in several places.&nbsp; The
incoming water soon converted the ballast into a liquid mass,
which surged about in the hold, finally hurling her upon her
side, and rendering her unmanageable.&nbsp; While in this
position, great seas swept over her, smashing all the boats and
loosening heavy spars, which washed about the decks, knocking
down the crew.&nbsp; Two sailors and the carpenter received
broken limbs in this manner, and before they could be rescued,
all three were washed into the sea and drowned before the eyes of
their shipmates.&nbsp; The mate was killed the following night by
the falling main mast, and to complete the horror of the
situation, the pumps became choked with mud, rendering them
useless.&nbsp; With water pouring <a name="page276"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 276</span>into every open seam, those aboard
the settling bark had resigned all hope, and were passively
waiting for death when the <i>Sagamore</i> hove in sight.</p>
<p>The ship&rsquo;s side having been safely reached, the rescued
men were quickly drawn up to the deck, and the boat again started
for the <i>Dundee</i>.&nbsp; It was a desperate chance whether
she remained above water until the gig could reach her; and each
time the little craft was lifted upon a wave the mate looked
anxiously towards the wreck, half expecting her to have vanished
while his boat was in the trough.&nbsp; What kept the bark afloat
during this interval was a mystery, but float she did, though
suspended as it were by a single hair above the fathomless
depths.</p>
<p>When the gig brought up under her stern, the rope was again
placed in position, and the apprentice told to descend.&nbsp; The
youth was half way to the boat when he became panic-stricken at
sight of a great sea coming on him, and cried for help.&nbsp; The
wreck rolled heavily towards the boat, slackening the rope still
further; the wave rolled over the apprentice, and when it passed,
there was the rope all on the surface, but the hands that had
grasped it a moment before were gone.&nbsp; The bark&rsquo;s <a
name="page277"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 277</span>captain ran
to the rail with a coil of rope ready to fling to the youth the
instant he should appear, but he was not seen, and hope of his
rescue had about gone, when Gene, with a sudden exclamation,
reached over the boat&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; He had the drowning man
by the hair!&nbsp; After a struggle which nearly capsized the
gig, the apprentice was dragged into it, more dead than
alive.&nbsp; Then the two remaining seamen made the trip without
accident, and the captain was ready&mdash;the last man to
leave.</p>
<p>He paused an instant, his eyes slowly taking in every detail
of the familiar scene.&nbsp; For fourteen years had he been
master of that bark, and even his unsympathetic nature was
stirred to its very depths at the moment of leaving her
forever.&nbsp; Now, in these last seconds of their long
association, a hundred past events were kindled into life again,
and flashed through his brain like the successive views of a
panorama.</p>
<p>Hastily turning away, he tossed into the boat a package
containing his sextant, a favorite chronometer, and the
bark&rsquo;s papers.&nbsp; He grasped the rope,&mdash;was soon in
the water,&mdash;at the boat&rsquo;s side,&mdash;and then safely
on board.&nbsp; At a signal from the mate, Gene severed the line
with his <a name="page278"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
278</span>sheath-knife, and the <i>Dundee</i> was abandoned to
her fate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; cried Mr. Marsh, &ldquo;give way with
a will&mdash;look out! she&rsquo;s going.&nbsp; Row, row for your
lives!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The wreck gave a sudden lurch and then recovered herself with
a staggering motion just at the moment when those in the boat so
dangerously near expected to see her founder.&nbsp; The oars were
plied vigorously, and the gig was more than half way to the ship
when Jumbo exclaimed, &ldquo;Look at her now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bark&rsquo;s last moment had come.&nbsp; Her bows rose
gradually out of the water, and she rolled slowly over,
disappearing stern foremost, as easily as though she were being
launched into that element which she had sailed so many years,
and which was now ending her existence.&nbsp; The fore mast, with
the distress signals fluttering in the breeze, was the last thing
to vanish; and as it sunk beneath the whirling vortex a groan
escaped Captain Murray.&nbsp; As chief owner of the
<i>Dundee</i>, his financial loss would be considerable, but
there was another stronger feeling.&nbsp; In the vessel which had
just descended to unknown depths he had traversed all the
waterways of the globe; she had been his only home <a
name="page279"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 279</span>for many
years, and seemed almost a part of himself.&nbsp; Kindred he had
none, and the old bark had absorbed whatever of latent affection
there was in his cold nature. Now she was gone as completely as
if she had never existed; a few spars, an empty cask, and the
torn British ensign, alone remaining to show where she had last
been seen.</p>
<p>There was a dead silence in that little boat (save for the
sound of the oars) for many minutes after the final scene.&nbsp;
All seemed awed, and when at length the ship&rsquo;s side was
reached, Captain Murray raised his head for the first time since
he had looked on his lost vessel.&nbsp; His eyes were moist with
the only tears that they had known since childhood.&nbsp; As he
climbed over the bulwarks, Captain Meade came forward&mdash;the
American warmly grasped the Englishman&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; With
rare tact, he spoke no word, but led his guest down the
companion-way and into the privacy of his own room, leaving Mr.
Marsh to attend to the proper disposition of the remainder of the
rescued.</p>
<h3><span class="smcap">Chapter</span> IV.</h3>
<p>There are few sights more thrilling than that of a vessel
foundering at sea; and <a name="page280"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 280</span>for several weeks the
<i>Sagamore&rsquo;s</i> people thought of little but the lost
bark and her crew.&nbsp; The <i>Dundee&rsquo;s</i> steward was
set to work in the galley, and the able seamen were divided
between the two watches, where each day&rsquo;s numerous duties
soon made them forget their recent hardships.&nbsp; Captain
Murray took the loss of his vessel much to heart, and was greatly
depressed for some days; but to distract his attention, he
voluntarily assumed the bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un&rsquo;s duties, and
became less despondent as time passed.</p>
<p>During the week following the rescue, the <i>Sagamore</i>,
with streaming decks, slowly but surely beat her way to the
westward against contrary winds.&nbsp; Sometimes it was useless
to attempt to proceed against the tremendous head sea, and she
was hove to for a time.&nbsp; Then a gale would swoop down, sails
would be furled or reefed; and after it was over, a few hours of
what Captain Meade facetiously called &ldquo;pleasant
weather&rdquo; would intervene.&nbsp; Then, if it happened to be
day, old Sol shed his kindly warmth upon the ship, and the leaden
sky was changed to an alluring blue.&nbsp; If night, the same
glorious harvest moon that shone on fields and vineyards far
away, here flooded the angry ocean <a name="page281"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 281</span>with her soft, mysterious
light.&nbsp; At such times, when it was possible to set a few
sails, the merry clank, clunk, clank, of the capstan was heard as
the heavy yards were hoisted, to the wild accompaniment of a
sailors&rsquo; chorus.&nbsp; Every day it was &ldquo;Tack
ship&rdquo; or &ldquo;All hands reef sail,&rdquo; until officers
and crew were well-nigh fagged out.&nbsp; Most of those on board
had been through the same experience many times, and knew that
until it ended, all they could do was to bear their trials as
best they could.</p>
<p>But one day there were indications of a change for the
better.&nbsp; The ship was so far to the west, that a fair wind
would enable her to steer north, cross the 50th. parallel, and
leave Cape Horn behind.&nbsp; The state of the barometer,
combined with other well known signs, led Captain Meade to
predict &ldquo;a regular old ripper from the southeast,&rdquo;
which was just what was wanted.</p>
<p>A violent snow-storm struck the <i>Sagamore</i> that evening,
soon covering the decks with a mantle of white.&nbsp; After it
ceased the wind nearly failed, and it was decided to put the ship
on the other tack, so as to be in readiness to receive the
south-easter which was felt to be at hand.&nbsp; When the <a
name="page282"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 282</span>passengers
came on deck after supper, the whole southern horizon was black
as pitch, sea and sky blending together in one dark, lowering
mass.&nbsp; All hands were called to strip the ship; halyards
were let go, sheets slackened, buntlines hauled in, and then the
men, in rubber boots and oilers, climbed the rigging and went out
upon the swaying yards.&nbsp; The gale struck her before the work
was concluded; the icy polar wind was soon screeching through the
rigging, to the accompaniment of whirling snow-flakes and flying
spray; hail-stones pattered on the deck; and amidst all this, the
port watch had to work an hour overtime before it was possible to
go below and get supper.&nbsp; It is not an enviable
task,&mdash;furling stiff, wet sails, one after another, while a
bitter wind blows with a force that makes it necessary to hold on
with one hand, to avoid being blown into the sea, while you work
with the other&mdash;and all this at an elevation of sixty or
seventy feet above the deck.&nbsp; The wind kept getting into the
belly of the half-frozen sails, making them slippery as inflated
balloons, and causing the men ten times the usual work to get
them laid on the yards; while the pelting snow and hail, combined
with the wild plunges of the ship, <a name="page283"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 283</span>made it difficult to retain their
precarious footing.&nbsp; But the job was finished at last, and
grog served out.</p>
<p>Mr. Marsh came below cold and wet, in spite of his oilers, and
his eyes heavy from loss of sleep.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this as bad a gale as you were ever
in?&rdquo; asked Hartley.&nbsp; &ldquo;They were stretching
life-lines on the quarter-deck when we came below, which is
certainly unusual.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mate looked at him a minute, and then burst out
irrelevantly, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d give a month&rsquo;s pay to have
the son of a sea-cook here who wrote &lsquo;A life on the ocean
wave.&rsquo;&nbsp; Hang me if I wouldn&rsquo;t heave him
overboard!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he proceeded to spread a blanket on
the floor before the stove, brought a pillow from his room, and
threw himself down in his clothes without more words.</p>
<p>The passengers spent the evening at the cabin windows,
watching the booming seas roll on board.&nbsp; Both knew they
were in for a night of it, and upon retiring, took the precaution
to place the &ldquo;weatherboards&rdquo; in the front side of
their berths, that they might not be pitched out before
morning.</p>
<p><a name="page284"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 284</span>Under
two topsails and a staysail, the ship tore through the water like
a race horse; plunging madly forward, while the big seas astern
chased her as a pack of wolves might pursue their prey.&nbsp; The
distinctive feature of this gale was that it came from the
southeast, instead of from the west, as all the previous ones had
done, and was, therefore, a fair wind.&nbsp; The one danger now
was, lest it should increase to such a degree that the ship would
be unable longer to run before it, thus losing the benefit of a
gale which, had it blown with less fury, would have carried her
flying across the 50th parallel in twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>Captain Meade was up all night, anxiously noting the behavior
of the ship, and calculating over and over the chances of being
able to keep on before the gale.&nbsp; Two of the three remaining
sails had been furled when the watches were changed at midnight,
yet still that six thousand tons of hull and cargo was driven
through the water at a rate almost beyond belief.&nbsp; Fast
though she went, the seas behind were beginning to travel more
swiftly still, and already two had broken over the stern.&nbsp;
Anxious as the captain was to go on, he was too good a seaman to
disregard these <a name="page285"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
285</span>warnings.&nbsp; In another hour the <i>Sagamore</i>
might be &ldquo;pooped&rdquo; at the rate the sea was running,
and so, after consulting with Mr. Marsh, he decided that the ship
must be hove to.&nbsp; He did not come to this conclusion without
great reluctance and some foreboding, for with the great sea
which was now on, the mere act of turning the ship around was
attended with great risk.&nbsp; In fact, when the mate was asked
for his opinion, he did not hesitate to say that he considered
running before the gale preferable to attempting to heave the
ship to.&nbsp; Better to stand the chance of being swamped, he
contended, than to try an operation which might result in
throwing the <i>Sagamore</i> upon her beam ends in the trough of
that mountainous sea.&nbsp; This contingency was what Captain
Meade also feared, but he decided that of the two dangers, going
about was the least.</p>
<p>Accordingly, soon after daybreak, Mr. Marsh bawled,
&ldquo;Wear ship,&rdquo; following this order with &ldquo;Port
fore brace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mate was clinging to the ladder on the lee side of the
forward house when he gave these orders, and before his watch
started to execute them, he spoke a few words of warning.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Now, men, you all know there&rsquo;s an ugly sea running,
so look <a name="page286"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
286</span>out for yourselves, and don&rsquo;t shift about without
holding fast to the life-lines.&nbsp; Port fore brace!&nbsp;
Andrew, you stand by the starboard brace ready to slack
away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jack and Montana were at the wheel, and Jumbo was at the
lookout.&nbsp; All the others save Andrew, pulled on the brace
until the mate shouted &ldquo;Belay!&nbsp; Now haul in your slack
to starboard.&rdquo;&nbsp; They started to cross the swimming
deck, the sea being then on the beam.&nbsp; Some had reached the
starboard brace, others were in the middle of the deck; while
Gene, who had stopped to make the port brace fast, was not a
third of the distance across.&nbsp; At this moment the ship gave
a wild roll, and the next, when her starboard bulwarks were far
down, an immense &ldquo;green sea&rdquo;&mdash;a solid wall of
water&mdash;broke on board.</p>
<p>What followed baffles description.&nbsp; Those who had hold of
the starboard brace escaped by clinging tightly to it and ducking
beneath the bulwarks, where they were buried under several feet
of water, but the others fared worse, being exposed to the full
force of the sea.&nbsp; Whether Norris, Smith, and Harry grasped
the life-lines or not, they never could clearly tell, but when
the ship rolled to port, the great sea swept them before it like
flies.&nbsp; <a name="page287"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
287</span>All three, by a providential circumstance, were knocked
down and jammed in between the iron stanchions and a spare spar
lashed to the bulwarks,&mdash;all that saved them from going
overboard.</p>
<p>But poor Gene!&nbsp; He was caught up like a bit of chaff, and
whirled away over the submerged port bulwarks.&nbsp; Everyone
near by, including the mate, had all he could do to save his own
life, and none of them knew for a few moments what had
happened.&nbsp; Captain Meade, from the quarter-deck, saw the
awful accident, and his cry of &ldquo;Man overboard!&rdquo; and
Gene&rsquo;s despairing shriek mingled together.&nbsp; The
captain was a cool man, and he desperately hurled a coil of rope
in less time than it takes to tell it, but even had the lost man
been able to grasp it, he could no more have held on at the rate
the ship was going than he could have seized a flash of
lightning.&nbsp; Before the words &ldquo;Man overboard&rdquo;
were well out of the speaker&rsquo;s mouth, the poor fellow was
disappearing astern; his white face and yellow sou&rsquo;-wester
being plainly visible for several minutes.</p>
<p>It is frightful to see a fellow creature perish before
one&rsquo;s eyes, and at the same time know that one is powerless
to render the least assistance&mdash;for before <a
name="page288"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 288</span>the
<i>Sagamore</i> could have been brought to a stand, Gene would
have been a mile or more astern.&nbsp; But even had he then been
in plain sight, no life boat ever constructed could have lived
five seconds in that boiling cauldron.&nbsp; The instant it
touched the water, it would have capsized or been crushed like an
egg shell against the vessel&rsquo;s side.&nbsp; Death is
repulsive at best to the young, even when the path leading to it
is smoothed over and made easier by loving friends and relatives,
or by the consolations of religious faith.&nbsp; But to be alive
and well one second, and then, before sixty seconds have told a
minute, to be swept from a vessel&rsquo;s deck and left to
drown&mdash;this is horrible beyond conception.&nbsp; What mental
tortures must that poor fellow have suffered before losing
consciousness, to see the ship, his only hope, vanishing in the
distance; and to know that there was not even one chance in a
thousand for his rescue.&nbsp; Thus was Gene lost off Cape
Horn.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, others might share the same fate unless prompt
action was taken, and the wonder was that the mate and his whole
watch had not perished with Gene.&nbsp; When the ship freed
herself from that sea, Harry and Smith managed to rise
unassisted, but <a name="page289"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
289</span>Norris lay as one dead, with blood trickling from a
wound on the forehead, where he had been thrown against the iron
stanchion.&nbsp; Mr. Marsh ran to where he lay, and dragged the
unconscious sailor from his perilous position, into the
forecastle.&nbsp; Here he had to be left until the job of wearing
ship was over, for the <i>Sagamore</i> was in more peril during
those few minutes than at any time during the voyage.</p>
<p>She came around without accident, though it was a close shave,
and one roll in particular, threw her over until the masts were
almost parallel with the ocean.&nbsp; She lay to, well, shipping
comparatively little water, and the mate at once investigated the
injuries of Norris.&nbsp; He had regained his senses, but felt
badly, having received a hard blow on the knee, besides an
internal hurt which caused him much pain.&nbsp; The wound on the
head proved not to be serious, and after his external injuries
had received attention, he was helped to his bunk and relieved
from duty until complete rest should have restored him.</p>
<p>The gale blew itself out in twelve hours, and broke shortly
after breakfast, a fine day succeeding a night of storm, anxiety,
and death.&nbsp; But an atmosphere of gloom pervaded the
ship.&nbsp; There was one empty <a name="page290"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 290</span>bunk in the forecastle; one man less
to stand his trick at the wheel or on the lookout; one hand less
to sing out as the watch hauled on the braces; and that one was
the merriest and most light-hearted of all.&nbsp; His
intelligence and ready ability were in marked contrast to the
ignorance and stupidity which characterized most of the crew, and
he was a pronounced favorite with all on board;&mdash;most of all
with Mr. Marsh, who was difficult to please.&nbsp; The mate felt
very badly over the matter, and would not discuss it, even with
the passengers.&nbsp; Captain Meade deplored the calamity also,
and said that during his score of years as master, he had never
before lost a man overboard from the deck, though three had been
killed at various times by falling from the yards.</p>
<p>The fatality was the subject of much discussion among the
crew.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;d of held onto the lines when he was
a-crossin&rsquo; of the deck, he&rsquo;d been here now,&rdquo;
said one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; said another.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
wonder when the captain&rsquo;ll auction off his
clothes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not for a month, mebbe.&nbsp; He had some good togs,
but I&rsquo;d be afeerd to wear &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page291"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
291</span>&ldquo;I never seen such an awful sea; it looked half
way up to the fore yard.&nbsp; Seems like Gene was too slick a
bird not to hold on to somethin&rsquo;, though.&nbsp; I&rsquo;ll
warrant he jumped for the main riggin&rsquo;, and missed
it.&nbsp; Only yesterday he was a-tellin&rsquo; of me how glad he
would be when the ship got into warmer latitudes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>San Quentin had so far said nothing, but now the old man gave
his opinion in a loud and authoritative voice that silenced the
discussion.&nbsp; &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t no use of
explainin&rsquo; how he was carried overboard, nor sayin&rsquo;
he&rsquo;d be here now &lsquo;if&rsquo; somethin&rsquo;
hadn&rsquo;t happened.&nbsp; His time had come, and he had to go,
and that&rsquo;s all there is about it.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m
more&rsquo;n twice as old as he was, but my time ain&rsquo;t
come, nor it won&rsquo;t for ten years yet.&rdquo;&nbsp; With
which prophecy the subject was dismissed.</p>
<p>When the mate wrote up the ship&rsquo;s log that afternoon, he
entered: &ldquo;Sept. 29th&mdash;88 days out&mdash;Long. 78&deg;
10&prime; W., Lat. 52&deg; 22&prime; S.&mdash;barometer 28:65;
slowly rising&mdash;very severe gale from S. E., with heavy
sea.&nbsp; Ran before it till daylight, then hove to&mdash;Pumps
carefully attended.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He though a moment, and added: &ldquo;Eugene Escarras, able
seaman, aged 25, a <a name="page292"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
292</span>native of Algiers, was washed overboard from the main
deck, and drowned.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was Gene&rsquo;s epitaph.</p>

<div class="gapshortline">&nbsp;</div>
<p>The third day after the south-easter, both sea and sky wore a
different aspect than either had presented for many weeks past,
and the air reminded one of the first balmy spring day after a
long winter.&nbsp; Even the moaning, whistling sound in the
rigging was gone, and the Cape pigeons and albatross circled
through the air with a seemingly new significance, which was
doubtless imaginary, as these Antarctic birds revel in storm and
cold.&nbsp; A gentle wind had come with the rising sun, and that
morning, for the first time in six weeks, the <i>Sagamore</i>
presented nearly her whole spread of canvas to the breeze;
everything, in fact, but skysails.</p>
<p>The bo&rsquo;s&rsquo;un&rsquo;s leg was mending finely, and
surgeon Hartley announced that he would soon be able to leave his
bunk.&nbsp; The two mates, ill-tempered from overwork, and worn
out from loss of sleep, knew their trials were nearly over, and
looked forward to the coming weeks of fair and pleasant weather
on the glorious Pacific.&nbsp; The various members of the crew
congratulated each other that their days <a
name="page293"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 293</span>of toil
were about over.&nbsp; Soon there would be no further use for
mittens, rubber boots and oil-skins, and on Sundays they could
lie around the warm dry decks or fish from the bows for
hours.&nbsp; San Quentin and Jumbo made a wager as to how soon
they could go barefooted, and everyone on board was in fine
spirits.</p>
<p>When Captain Meade worked out his sights that noon, he
announced to the passengers that the 50th parallel had been
crossed during the forenoon watch, on the 79th meridian of west
longitude!</p>
<p>After twenty-six days, the ship was around Cape Horn.</p>
<p>The two captains and the passengers stood about the cabin
table with the chart spread out before them, and Captain Meade
said, as they clinked glasses, &ldquo;Gentlemen, let us wish the
<i>Sagamore</i> a fifty days&rsquo; run from here to San
Francisco.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary 
Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
